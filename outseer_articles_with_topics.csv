Report: Why Collaboration Via 3-D Secure is Key to Beating CNP Fraud | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/3-d-secure-beating-cnp-fraud,2021-11-09,"Report: Why Collaboration Via 3-D Secure is Key to Beating CNP Fraud
Curious about why 3-D secure does such a good job at stopping CNP Fraud? Scroll down to learn more.
The largest-ever global study of EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS) adoption finds that its unrivalled value in defeating card-not-present (CNP) fraud can be dramatically amplified with participation from the vast majority of the card payment ecosystem.
For merchants, card companies, and payments networks, the payoff could be huge. After swelling to $4.2 trillion this past year, the research from Outseer and Aite-Novarica Group estimates that total e-commerce sales could hit $5.9 trillion by 2023. And that could be low-balling it, if consumer enthusiasm for CNP-enabled online and mobile purchases and popular payment options like Buy-Online-Pickup-in-Store (BOPIS) continues to intensify.
Of course, revenues are one thing, profits another. As digital channel sales have been reaching new heights over the past 18 months, so has CNP fraud. Within the next two years, this crime could lead to $17.2 billion in lost revenue annually.
But data from the study also demonstrates that as digital commerce and new payment models scale, 3DS is proving remarkably effective in helping to strike the optimum balance between mitigating risk and maintaining a seamless customer experience.
That alone warrants a collective sigh of relief. Even better: Evidence showing that as crucial as 3DS adoption can be for individual organizations, the benefits grow exponentially more pronounced when adoption among other organizations reaches critical mass. To understand why, let’s look at some key findings from the study.
3-D Secure Adoption: More Isn’t Just More—It’s Stronger
Today, growth of 3-D Secure deployment among merchants, issuers, payments networks and governments is accelerating across all geographies. During the first half of 2021, the total share of 3DS-enabled transactions grew 79% worldwide. In regions like the UK and the European Union, nearly half (46%) of all CNP transactions are now 3DS-protected—up from just 7% in the third quarter of 2020.
Unfortunately, the pace of all this growth isn’t distributed evenly. According to the Aite-Novarica Group research, the US lags behind regions like the EU, India, and Australia, where either governmental or payment network mandates for multifactor authentication (MFA) are in effect and where 3DS is seen as an essential deterrent to CNP fraud.
In the US, this disparity contributes to what is estimated to be $7.9 billion in CNP fraud loss in 2021. That’s more than half the total $15.3 billion in CNP fraud loss expected this year in all other regions combined.
In fact, one of the clearest findings in the research is how much the benefits of 3DS adoption accrue when there is widespread participation from issuers and merchants. In the EU, for example, net CNP fraud loss hovers at a manageable 7 basis points. In the US, net CNP fraud is 17 bps.
Stopping Fraud, Boosting Profits
That last part is reason enough for organizations in the US that might want to put 3DS adoption front and center—but as our CEO Reed Taussig recently pointed out, there’s plenty more. 3-D Secure isn’t just a good idea in terms of loss prevention, either. It’s actually a boon to business.
That’s because 3DS-based solutions analyze hundreds of risk indicators to silently authenticate customers before a transaction even happens, enabling merchants and issuers to deliver a fast, friendly checkout experience to legitimate customers while blocking fraudsters at the door.
Our own solution, for example, enhances 3DS with identity science and globally shared transaction data to prevent more than 95% of all fraud loss while reserving step-up challenges for that scant 5% of all transactions that are high risk. In just the first half of 2021, we’ve protected more than $100 billion in CNP transactions worldwide.
But there’s also another benefit. Solutions employing 3-D Secure has been shown to reduce checkout times by 85% and cart abandonment by 70%. Put it all together, and for merchants and card issuers, it means more revenue and more profitability. And if the findings in the Aite-Novarica study are any indication, the more organizations to join the party, the merrier it is for everyone but the fraudsters.

3-D Secure: Navigating Compliance Changes | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/3-d-secure-navigating-compliance-changes,2024-04-29,"3-D Secure: Navigating Compliance Changes
Ensuring security and compliance in Card-not-present (CNP) payments remains paramount. Among the arsenal of tools and protocols aimed at fortifying payment integrity, EMVCo is the global standard that sits alongside card schemes, regional and local regulations. Yet, comprehending its complexities and staying abreast of compliance changes presents a challenge for stakeholders across the payment ecosystem.
As CNP and e-commerce transactions continue their exponential rise, so does the looming threat of fraud. Projections depict a staggering surge in total payment card volume, paralleled by an alarming increase in fraudulent activities. Regions such as North America, Latin America, and Asia Pacific grapple with significant fraud challenges, underscoring the urgent need for financial institutions to adopt EMV® 3-D Secure and similar regulations such as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA).
In this context, let’s explore EMVCo in detail, understanding its mechanisms and intricacies. We’ll also examine Outseer’s role in ensuring standard compliance, its adept adaptation to regional nuances like SCA regulations, and its facilitation of local compliance intricacies, such as Sweden’s Bank ID.
EMVCo’s Pivotal Role in Setting Industry Standards for Global Compliance
EMVCo, a consortium owned by major payment networks, spearheads the establishment of industry standards for payment security and interoperability. By adhering to EMV specifications, stakeholders ensure compatibility with global payment standards, fostering a secure and cohesive ecosystem.
EMV® 3-D Secure encompasses a multi-faceted approach involving consumers, merchants, card networks, and issuers. At its core, it seeks to authenticate cardholders during online transactions, thereby reducing the risk of fraud. Understanding the roles of each stakeholder is crucial to comprehending the framework’s efficacy.
- Consumer: EMV® 3-D Secure prompts consumers to authenticate themselves using multiple factors, such as passwords, biometric data, or tokens, ensuring the legitimacy of the transaction.
- Merchant (3DS): Merchants integrate 3-D Secure protocols into their checkout processes, enabling secure authentication and mitigating the risk of unauthorized transactions.
- Card Network (Directory Server): Card networks maintain directory servers that facilitate the authentication process by providing necessary information to merchants and issuers.
- Issuer (Access Control Server): Issuers operate access control servers to validate transaction requests, leveraging advanced algorithms and data analytics to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.
Credit Card Network Schemes for Global Compliance
Alignment with major credit card network schemes is essential for ensuring global compliance. This alignment involves adherence to standards and integration with network protocols to ensure global reach.
Here’s how a card scheme facilitates transactions: initially, when a customer makes a purchase using their payment card, whether in-store or online, the transaction is initiated. Subsequently, the payment details are communicated to the merchant’s bank. Then, the bank forwards an authorization request to the pertinent card scheme, such as Visa or Mastercard. The card scheme then routes this request to the customer’s bank for fund verification and card validity confirmation. Based on this assessment, the transaction is either approved or denied. If approved, the payment is processed through the card scheme and deposited into the merchant’s account. Scheme owners commonly enforce compliance requirements on banks and technology providers to utilize their card schemes, thereby ensuring global standards are upheld.
By embracing and adhering to scheme mandates through Outseer support and expertise, card issuers mitigate the complexities of cross-border transactions, paving the way for frictionless commerce while fortifying defenses against fraud.
Regional Regulation & Compliance: Strong Customer Authentication
Navigating regional compliance requirements, particularly in the realm of card not present (CNP) payments, poses a challenge for stakeholders globally. The European Union’s Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) stands out as a prime example of regulatory evolution, with its SCA mandate significantly impacting CNP transactions.
Implementing SCA-compliant authentication measures is crucial not only for meeting regulatory obligations but also for enhancing security in online transactions while simultaneously minimizing customer friction. In regions like the EU, where SCA is enforced, successful compliance strategies highlight the importance of partnering with 3-D Secure ACS providers. Such partnerships facilitate the adoption of robust authentication mechanisms, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards while optimizing operational efficiency for merchants and financial institutions alike.
Regional regulation compliance often extends beyond the originating region, with numerous regions worldwide implementing their own frameworks and adaptations. This global trend reflects the diverse regulatory environments and the need for tailored approaches to address specific regional requirements and challenges. For instance, Australia has developed its regulatory equivalent of SCA to enhance payment security.
These adaptations highlight the significance of comprehending and navigating the complexities of compliance frameworks in pivotal regions. Outseer’s swift support for major customers in areas like EMEA/UK concerning new regulatory requirements facilitates fast and easy adaptation and compliance, ensuring seamless support for customers in other regions when similar regulations are implemented.
Local Compliance Intricacies: Sweden’s BankID
BankID is the mandatory electronic identification method in Sweden, playing a crucial role in authorizing payments and transfers securely. However, its adoption has also made it a target for fraudsters who exploit its popularity and trust among users.
Common frauds associated with BankID include fake bank support, scams via companies or friend on social media and ID theft via security token. These fake support and scams, trick individuals into disclosing their BankID credentials, and identity theft, where fraudsters use stolen BankID information to conduct unauthorized transactions.
To combat this, Outseer through its 3-D Secure solution introduced QR challenge flows for online transactions. The QR code feature is particularly beneficial when consumers access an online merchant’s platform using a device different from the one where they have their Mobile BankID stored, such as a personal computer, tablet, or public device. This additional layer of security ensures that transactions remain protected, even across various devices, strengthening consumer confidence in online purchases.
Outseer: Leading the Way in Regulation & Compliance Expertise
When comes to global, regional and local regulations, Outseer’s 3-D Secure solution provides customized and best practice approaches to compliance and risk mitigation.
With knowledge and expertise for compliance at both global and regional levels, Outseer help financial institutions swiftly adapt to not only global regulations but also pivot to comply with regional and local regulations as they evolve across different regions. Features like QR challenge flows not only enhance security but also cater to diverse consumer preferences and adhere to localized regulations.
This adaptability ensures that institutions remain compliant and competitive in the dynamic regulatory environment.

- Consumer: EMV® 3-D Secure prompts consumers to authenticate themselves using multiple factors, such as passwords, biometric data, or tokens, ensuring the legitimacy of the transaction.
- Merchant (3DS): Merchants integrate 3-D Secure protocols into their checkout processes, enabling secure authentication and mitigating the risk of unauthorized transactions.
- Card Network (Directory Server): Card networks maintain directory servers that facilitate the authentication process by providing necessary information to merchants and issuers.
- Issuer (Access Control Server): Issuers operate access control servers to validate transaction requests, leveraging advanced algorithms and data analytics to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.
Credit Card Network Schemes for Global Compliance
Alignment with major credit card network schemes is essential for ensuring global compliance. This alignment involves adherence to standards and integration with network protocols to ensure global reach.
Here’s how a card scheme facilitates transactions: initially, when a customer makes a purchase using their payment card, whether in-store or online, the transaction is initiated. Subsequently, the payment details are communicated to the merchant’s bank. Then, the bank forwards an authorization request to the pertinent card scheme, such as Visa or Mastercard. The card scheme then routes this request to the customer’s bank for fund verification and card validity confirmation. Based on this assessment, the transaction is either approved or denied. If approved, the payment is processed through the card scheme and deposited into the merchant’s account. Scheme owners commonly enforce compliance requirements on banks and technology providers to utilize their card schemes, thereby ensuring global standards are upheld.
By embracing and adhering to scheme mandates through Outseer support and expertise, card issuers mitigate the complexities of cross-border transactions, paving the way for frictionless commerce while fortifying defenses against fraud.
Regional Regulation & Compliance: Strong Customer Authentication
Navigating regional compliance requirements, particularly in the realm of card not present (CNP) payments, poses a challenge for stakeholders globally. The European Union’s Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) stands out as a prime example of regulatory evolution, with its SCA mandate significantly impacting CNP transactions.
Implementing SCA-compliant authentication measures is crucial not only for meeting regulatory obligations but also for enhancing security in online transactions while simultaneously minimizing customer friction. In regions like the EU, where SCA is enforced, successful compliance strategies highlight the importance of partnering with 3-D Secure ACS providers. Such partnerships facilitate the adoption of robust authentication mechanisms, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards while optimizing operational efficiency for merchants and financial institutions alike.
Regional regulation compliance often extends beyond the originating region, with numerous regions worldwide implementing their own frameworks and adaptations. This global trend reflects the diverse regulatory environments and the need for tailored approaches to address specific regional requirements and challenges. For instance, Australia has developed its regulatory equivalent of SCA to enhance payment security.
These adaptations highlight the significance of comprehending and navigating the complexities of compliance frameworks in pivotal regions. Outseer’s swift support for major customers in areas like EMEA/UK concerning new regulatory requirements facilitates fast and easy adaptation and compliance, ensuring seamless support for customers in other regions when similar regulations are implemented.
Local Compliance Intricacies: Sweden’s BankID
BankID is the mandatory electronic identification method in Sweden, playing a crucial role in authorizing payments and transfers securely. However, its adoption has also made it a target for fraudsters who exploit its popularity and trust among users.
Common frauds associated with BankID include fake bank support, scams via companies or friend on social media and ID theft via security token. These fake support and scams, trick individuals into disclosing their BankID credentials, and identity theft, where fraudsters use stolen BankID information to conduct unauthorized transactions.
To combat this, Outseer through its 3-D Secure solution introduced QR challenge flows for online transactions. The QR code feature is particularly beneficial when consumers access an online merchant’s platform using a device different from the one where they have their Mobile BankID stored, such as a personal computer, tablet, or public device. This additional layer of security ensures that transactions remain protected, even across various devices, strengthening consumer confidence in online purchases.

3-D Secure: Everything You Need to Know | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/3-d-secure-need-to-know,2021-09-08,"3-D Secure: Everything You Need to Know
Wondering about 3-D Secure? We explain what it is and how this extra layer of security prevents fraudulent credit and debit card transactions.
What Is 3-D Secure?
3-D Secure (3DS) is a payment protocol designed to provide an additional layer of protection to help prevent fraud by enabling consumers to authenticate themselves with their payment card issuers when making purchase in digital channels. The “3D” stands for the three domains three parties, or “domains”—the acquirer bank, the issuer bank, and the infrastructure supporting the protocol, whether it’s the Internet or software providers.
Arcot Systems and VISA first developed the protocol to improve the security of online payments and reduce fraud. Merchants used the first version of the 3DS protocol in 1999 to stop fraudulent purchases online and enhance the security of digital payments.
This version, along with 3DS 1.0 (or 3DS1) helped reduce fraud, but also introduced numerous problems for e-commerce. Among other things, it required credit card users to enroll in the system using static passwords that many would promptly forget. When making a purchase, 3DS assessed 15 rudimentary data elements to verify identity. And because 3DS shifted liability for fraudulent purchases to card issuers, they often took a “better safe than sorry” approach that meant friction was all but guaranteed.
What’s more, a lot changed over the next 15 years—including the adoption of mobile as the go-to channel for Web browsing and purchases. With 3DS1, mobile users who couldn’t remember their passwords were redirected to a bank page that, more times than not, wasn’t optimized for mobile. SMS was used as an alternative, but presented issues of its own.
These extra steps caused a spike in cart abandonment and online conversion rates cratered. With card issuers responsible for fraudulent transactions, removing this secondary form of authentication wasn’t going to happen. It would be another 15 years before a solution would emerge.
3-D Secure 2.0 Improvements
In 2016, 3DS2 was developed to overcome the limitations found in early versions of the protocol. The second version was completely redesigned to improve security and provide a frictionless flow experience for legitimate customers. 3DS2 represented a significant improvement because it:
- Supports mobile phones and other consumer-connected devices
- At purchase, data is sent first to the issuing bank to see if it needs additional verification
- Only risky transactions require challenges; otherwise, a “frictionless flow” process is initiated
This enables merchants to integrate the authentication process into their checkout experiences. Issuing banks can authorize payments using risk-based authentication, with no additional steps required by consumers.
The Rise of 3DS 2.1 and 2.2
One of the latest improvements to 3-D Secure was published in 2019 as 3DS 2.1 increases the number of data elements merchants send to issuers at the point of transaction to 100, with 20 required and the rest optional but recommended by EMVCo, the consortium behind the standards.
A richer dataset that includes information such as email and IP address, shipping address, and device status are shared with the issuer, allowing issuers to authenticate transactions faster—enabling far more transactions to be handled without friction.
3DS 2.2 not only builds on the foundation of the previous version but also adds the ability to authenticate through their acquirer or digital wallet provider. For these reasons and more, 3-D Secure has become the cornerstone of online payment authentication.
How 3-D Secure Works
With the advent of 3DS2, card issuers and payments processors no longer have to choose between lowering fraud at the cost of conversions. But how does 3-D Secure fraud prevention work?
Authentication Request
At checkout, the customer enters their card details. Behind the scenes, the merchant’s 3-D Secure provider sends an authorization request to the issuer. This request contains over 100 data points about the cardholder, their device, and previous transactions they have made.
Risk Assessment
The issuer’s 3-D Secure provider receives the data-rich request and assigns that transaction a risk score. These data points are compared against threat models using machine learning and statistical analysis. This method of fraud detection happens in mere seconds.
Authentication or Challenge
If there is enough data to authenticate the user, the transaction proceeds through a frictionless flow, with no other input required from the customer. If the transaction is suspicious, the customer is sent through a challenging flow to provide additional information.
Challenges may include a One Time Password (OTP) sent via text, a biometric fingerprint scan, or some other measure. Advancements in risk-based authentication have dramatically reduced transaction fraud while preserving the customers online experience.
The Importance Of 3-D Secure 2.x
Organizations that have migrated to Outseer 3-D Secure reap cost savings from fewer chargebacks and related losses. But there are also numerous other benefits.
Higher Online Conversion Rates
Experts state that 3DS2 has reduced checkout times by 85% and cart abandonment by 70%. Thanks to mobile compatibility and larger data sets in 3DS2, customers experience fewer interruptions and a better experience across their devices. This translates to revenue increases for banks and card networks, and more interchange fees for issuers.
Rock Solid Security
Because of its use of two-factor authentication (including biometrics and token-based models, instead of static passwords) 3DS2 is central to the secure customer authentication (SCA) rules in the EU’s second Payment Services Directive (PSD2). As part of that version, merchants hitting low fraud thresholds can request exemption from SCA requirements from the issuer, providing for even faster transactions.
While the United States doesn’t currently enforce SCA, it’s still catching on for a number of reasons.
While merchants and issuers doing business in the EU’s $300 billion ecommerce market are exempt from PSD2’s SCA requirements, that could change. What’s more, regulatory fervor is spreading everywhere—Australia, Mexico and others have started to enact SCA requirements. It’s simply just a matter of time before state and federal regulators begin mandating such standards as well. Which means implementing the latest version of 3-D Secure will help keep organizations ahead of the curve.
Merchant-friendly Features
Many merchants have resisted the EMV 3-D Secure protocol over concerns about it interfering with the consumer check-out experience. Admittedly, the first version of the protocol was cumbersome for consumers and led to increased cart abandonment rates. Thankfully, the second version provides for a completely frictionless experience. It also introduced a number of features to make the protocol more appealing to merchants than ever.
- An extension of the shift in liability, whereby merchants are no longer responsible for covering the cost of fraudulent transactions
- Automatic enrollment of consumers in the program so they no longer need to sign up themselves
- Additional data elements that can yield more accurate assessments of fraud transaction risk in real time are included
- Merchants gain the ability to make the final call on whether or not to challenge a user for step-up authentication
- Support for multiple payment channels, including mobile devices, digital wallets, and gaming consoles as transaction volumes, values (and fraud) keep climbing

3-D Secure Authentication: What It Is & Why It’s Needed | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/3d-secure-authentication,2021-12-09,"3-D Secure Authentication: What It Is & Why It’s Needed
Are you wondering about 3-D Secure authentication? We explain what 3-D Secure authentication is, how it works, and how it helps protect merchants and customers from fraudulent transactions.
What Is 3-D Secure Authentication?
The EMV® 3-D Secure payment protocol is designed to provide an additional layer of protection to help prevent fraud. 3-D Secure authentication is a process where customers verify their identity with their payment card issuers when making purchases in digital channels.
Businesses use the 3-D Secure protocol to protect from fraud without impacting their customers or slowing down legitimate transactions. The latest version of 3-D Secure authentication uses frictionless flow, which preserves the customer experience by only intervening when a transaction is highly suspicious.
Why Is 3-D Secure Authentication Important?
The more consumers and businesses continue to shift to e-commerce and digital payment methods, the more cybercriminals look to exploit card-not-present (CNP) transactions. Without traditional safeguards such as chip readers or PIN-pad devices, card issuers and merchants leave themselves and consumers at higher risk of fraud. In 2021, CNP fraud loss topped $15.3 billion, and could exceed $17.2 billion by 2023.
Payments that have been successfully authenticated using the 3-D Secure (3DS) protocol are covered by liability shift. Liability shift is how banks and processors handle fraud and incentivize all parties to follow best fraud prevention practices.
As CNP transactions continue to gain popularity, more merchants and issuers stay ahead of regulatory requirements such as SCA by using 3-D Secure authentication. In 2021, Outseer noted a continuous rise in 3-D secure authentication in the United Kingdom, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and the western world. While SCA isn’t mandatory in the United States, many believe it’s only a matter of time before similar regulatory requirements are put in place.
What Kind of Fraud Does 3-D Secure Authentication Protect Transactions from?
3-D Secure authentication helps combat CNP fraud by ensuring the legitimate cardholder is the one making a purchase.
With the dark web awash with breached credit card data, fraudsters can easy acquire high volumes of credit card numbers and other personal information—or steal it through phishing scams. So 3-D Secure transparently authenticates cardholders by assessing as many as 100 different data elements.
In the rare instance additional scrutiny is warranted, one-time passcodes (OTPs) or other out-of-band authentication can be used to verify the relationship between the cardholder and a transaction. OTPs are typically sent via text, email, or push notification but can also be generated through two-factor authentication apps. This process uses separate channels to verify the identity of the customer further.
In addition to OTPs, businesses can also use biometric data in 3-D Secure authentication. For example, voice print verification can be used while on the phone, while a fingerprint scan can be used during a touchless transaction.
How 3-D Secure Authentication Works
3-D Secure involves three different parties or “domains” to function, the acquiring bank, the issuing bank, and the infrastructure used to support the protocol. Together these three parties share information about the transaction, known fraud, and the cardholder to determine the risk of a transaction and prevent fraud.
Authentication Request
During checkout, the customer enters their card details and submits their payment details. In mere seconds the 3-D Secure provider sends a data-rich request to the card issuer. This request contains over 100 different data points that help the issuer understand the risk associated with the transaction. These data points include:
- Device age
- Account age
- Device ID
- IP address
- Transaction amount and history
- Session statistics (browser type, typing speed, etc.)
This contextual data is key to securing transactions, and helps pave the way for more robust forms of payment authentication.
Assessment
The request is received by the issuer’s 3-D Secure provider and assigns the transaction a risk score. This score is generated by comparing the data in the request to statistical threat models. Thanks to machine learning algorithms, this process only takes a few seconds.
Authentication or Challenge Flow
If there is enough data to determine the cardholder’s identity, the customer proceeds through checkout without additional steps. This ensures legitimate customers receive a frictionless experience when shopping and helps improve conversion rates and reduce cart abandonment.
If the transaction is deemed high risk, the customer is sent through a challenge flow for additional verification. This is where the merchant’s 3D-Secure authentication kicks in. The user will be required to authenticate themselves via OTP or biometric scan. If the customer passes the authentication challenge flow, they proceed to checkout.
Fraud Protection Doesn’t Have to Cost You Conversions
3D-Secure providers can make highly accurate risk assessments that streamline checkout, prevent fraud, and build brand loyalty by leveraging the latest statistical models, partner insights, and threat intelligence.

To learn how you can protect your customers through the power of frictionless fraud prevention, request a free demo today.","3-D Secure authentication is a payment protocol designed to protect merchants and customers from CNP fraud by verifying the cardholder's identity during online transactions. It works by sharing transaction information between acquiring and issuing banks, and uses risk assessment to provide a frictionless experience for low-risk transactions while challenging high-risk ones with methods like OTPs or biometrics. As CNP fraud rises, 3-D Secure authentication is becoming increasingly important for liability shift and regulatory compliance, with solutions like Outseer aiming to minimize fraud without impacting user experience.","breach, credit card, fraud, phishing, scam",5,2021-12-09,"3-D Secure Authentication: What It Is & Why It’s Needed | Outseer. 3-D Secure Authentication: What It Is & Why It’s Needed
Are you wondering about 3-D Secure authentication? We explain what 3-D Secure authentication is, how it works, and how it helps protect merchants and customers from fraudulent transactions.
What Is 3-D Secure Authentication?
The EMV® 3-D Secure payment protocol is designed to provide an additional layer of protection to help prevent fraud. 3-D Secure authentication is a process where customers verify their identity with their payment card issuers when making purchases in digital channels.
Businesses use the 3-D Secure protocol to protect from fraud without impacting their customers or slowing down legitimate transactions. The latest version of 3-D Secure authentication uses frictionless flow, which preserves the customer experience by only intervening when a transaction is highly suspicious.
Why Is 3-D Secure Authentication Important?
The more consumers and businesses continue to shift to e-commerce and digital payment methods, the more cybercriminals look to exploit card-not-present (CNP) transactions. Without traditional safeguards such as chip readers or PIN-pad devices, card issuers and merchants leave themselves and consumers at higher risk of fraud. In 2021, CNP fraud loss topped $15.3 billion, and could exceed $17.2 billion by 2023.
Payments that have been successfully authenticated using the 3-D Secure (3DS) protocol are covered by liability shift. Liability shift is how banks and processors handle fraud and incentivize all parties to follow best fraud prevention practices.
As CNP transactions continue to gain popularity, more merchants and issuers stay ahead of regulatory requirements such as SCA by using 3-D Secure authentication. In 2021, Outseer noted a continuous rise in 3-D secure authentication in the United Kingdom, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and the western world. While SCA isn’t mandatory in the United States, many believe it’s only a matter of time before similar regulatory requirements are put in place.
What Kind of Fraud Does 3-D Secure Authentication Protect Transactions from?
3-D Secure authentication helps combat CNP fraud by ensuring the legitimate cardholder is the one making a purchase.
With the dark web awash with breached credit card data, fraudsters can easy acquire high volumes of credit card numbers and other personal information—or steal it through phishing scams. So 3-D Secure transparently authenticates cardholders by assessing as many as 100 different data elements.
In the rare instance additional scrutiny is warranted, one-time passcodes (OTPs) or other out-of-band authentication can be used to verify the relationship between the cardholder and a transaction. OTPs are typically sent via text, email, or push notification but can also be generated through two-factor authentication apps. This process uses separate channels to verify the identity of the customer further.
In addition to OTPs, businesses can also use biometric data in 3-D Secure authentication. For example, voice print verification can be used while on the phone, while a fingerprint scan can be used during a touchless transaction.
How 3-D Secure Authentication Works
3-D Secure involves three different parties or “domains” to function, the acquiring bank, the issuing bank, and the infrastructure used to support the protocol. Together these three parties share information about the transaction, known fraud, and the cardholder to determine the risk of a transaction and prevent fraud.
Authentication Request
During checkout, the customer enters their card details and submits their payment details. In mere seconds the 3-D Secure provider sends a data-rich request to the card issuer. This request contains over 100 different data points that help the issuer understand the risk associated with the transaction. These data points include:
- Device age
- Account age
- Device ID
- IP address
- Transaction amount and history
- Session statistics (browser type, typing speed, etc.)
This contextual data is key to securing transactions, and helps pave the way for more robust forms of payment authentication.
Assessment
The request is received by the issuer’s 3-D Secure provider and assigns the transaction a risk score. This score is generated by comparing the data in the request to statistical threat models. Thanks to machine learning algorithms, this process only takes a few seconds.
Authentication or Challenge Flow
If there is enough data to determine the cardholder’s identity, the customer proceeds through checkout without additional steps. This ensures legitimate customers receive a frictionless experience when shopping and helps improve conversion rates and reduce cart abandonment.
If the transaction is deemed high risk, the customer is sent through a challenge flow for additional verification. This is where the merchant’s 3D-Secure authentication kicks in. The user will be required to authenticate themselves via OTP or biometric scan. If the customer passes the authentication challenge flow, they proceed to checkout.

5 Post-Pandemic Payments Trends | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/5-post-pandemic-payments-trends,2021-08-13,"5 Post-Pandemic Payments Trends
As Main Street reopens in fits and starts, innovation is at the top of the agenda for card issuers, banks, and payments processors facing new competition. Here’s a look at five key trends gaining traction in a post-pandemic world.
5 Post-Pandemic Payments Trends
If you think the last 18 months have been wild, just wait until you see where post-pandemic payments trends are headed next. Without a doubt, the seismic shift to digital channels precipitated by the global outbreak of COVID-19 transformed virtually every facet of our lives. That includes the way we conduct business, entertain ourselves, connect with one another, and shop.
Whether it’s through the web, mobile, ATMs, IVR, open APIs, or a growing constellation of other options, even consumers who were once intimidated by supermarket self-service checkout lanes now routinely buy food, clothes, rideshare trips, and even real estate using whatever device and channel they have at hand. Last year, global ecommerce spending on everything from Puppy Chow to Peloton exercise bikes topped $4.2 trillion—an increase of $1 trillion in just 12 months.
But something else changed along the way. Sure, consumers and businesses may have flocked to digital channels because that was the only game in town. But the ease and convenience they discovered there have sent customer expectations for all transactions into the stratosphere. As Main Street reopens in fits and starts, innovation is at the top of the agenda for card issuers, banks, and payments processors facing new competition. Here’s a look at five key trends gaining traction in a post-pandemic world.
#1 Risk-based Authentication Meets Identity
Whether combined with biometrics or other technologies, risk-based authentication is now key to point-of-truth fraud prevention. Solutions that build upon the features available in the 3D Secure v2.2 protocol and other technologies, for instance, analyze hundreds of risk indicators to silently authenticate customers before a transaction even happens.
I’m obviously biased, but this is kind of a big deal. Because of its use of two-factor authentication (including biometrics and token-based models instead of static passwords), 3DS2 has become the cornerstone of secure customer authentication (SCA) rules mandated in the EU’s second Payment Services Directive (PSD2). As regulatory fervor spreads worldwide, merchants and issuers will increasingly need SCA-enabled transactions to sustain growth. And it’s only a matter of time before state or even federal regulations requiring such standards are enacted in the U.S.
It’s also just smart business. According to VISA Research, up to 72% of online shoppers have abandoned a shopping cart over security concerns. Fickle consumers are more than happy to jump to competitors who can deliver fast, secure transactions. 3DS2 has been shown to reduce checkout times by 85% and cart abandonment by 70%. Best of all, North American issuers, merchants, and others can leverage fully-hosted solutions that deliver world-class protection without additional overhead.
Outseer 3-D Secure, for example, combines the 3DS2 with identity science and data from 20 billion annual transactions spanning every industry and geography worldwide. In real-world deployments, these solutions prevent 95% of all fraud loss while interrupting only 5% of all transactions. In addition to increased revenue, fewer false positives and less intervention make for better transaction experiences and happier customers.
As I look at so many new business and transaction models taking shape in a post-pandemic world, I’m of the firm belief that superior transaction experiences shouldn’t come with painful compromises—or any compromise at all.
#2 Payments Options Increasingly Drive Buying Decisions
More than 57% of consumers now choose businesses based in part on the payment methods they offer—bringing new urgency to fast, flexible, and secure transactions. Thanks to all those online and mobile purchases under lockdown, credit card usage rose from 54% to 65%, and the use of e-wallets grew from 39% to 52%.
While many of these transactions involved traditional home delivery, they also blurred the line between click- and brick-based commerce. For example, retailers offering buy-online-pickup-in-store prior to the pandemic report BOPIS sales rose 70% by volume, and 58% by value, within months of the first COVID-related lockdowns. Since then, nearly half have launched or expanded such offerings, while 45% have done the same for curbside pickup.
Throw in scan-and-go, pay-at-the-gate, and pay-at-the-table transaction options, and it’s easy to see why nearly 60% of consumers now say they’d choose a business with these and other contactless payment options over a competitor that lacks them.
This is also all just the beginning. In a post-pandemic world, watch for the Internet of Things, mobile wallets, 5G wireless, and other technologies to increasingly drive checkout-free transactions that occur automatically, behind the scenes—no action from the customer required. According to reports, companies such as Verizon and Mastercard are actively developing the kind of “invisible payments” solutions that won’t just redefine the point of sale—they’ll eliminate it.
#3 Embedded Finance Fuels New Revenue Growth
Consumers and businesses have long looked to traditional banks or card issuers as their primary and most trusted providers of money-related services. But today, a new generation of fintech platforms and API providers makes it possible for any company to embed bank-grade financial products and services within their own digital platforms.
Companies from Starbucks to Uber offer embedded payments and other financial instruments within their mobile apps. Venmo and PayPal are being morphed into a single “super app” designed to offer a wide array of financial services, from basic bank accounts, to investing, to peer-to-peer (P2P) payment options, and more. Square is looking to do the same for its SMB customers—and likely others, given its blockbuster $29 billion acquisition of BNPL giant Afterpay.
It’s easy to understand the frissons. In recent years, merchants have hit pay dirt with installment-based, buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) payments options made available via their sites and apps. According to Adobe, the number of people choosing BNPL for online purchases rose 215% from early 2020 to early 2021. And today, PayPal, Apple, and others are betting big that BNPL will turbocharge brick-and-mortar purchases as well. Given the stakes, you can see why VISA and other credit card companies are rapidly piloting BNPL services of their own.
According to The Financial Brand, the embedded finance industry could generate $230 billion by 2025 in the U.S., and as much as $7.2 trillion globally by 2030. Look for everybody from phone companies and corner cafes to begin offering everything from spot loans to prepaid debit cards—and for more traditional financial services companies to roll out differentiated offerings of their own.
#4 Transaction Fraud Spreading Like Wildfire
Fraudsters always follow the money. As these and other new payment models scale, organizations must be prepared for the corresponding rise in fraud risk that will accompany them.
Losses from card-not-present (CNP) fraud is estimated to have topped $6.4 billion in 2020, according to Aite Group—and could increase another 16.4% this year. Meanwhile, account takeover (ATO) attacks on sites and apps now lead to more than $16 billion in loss in the U.S. alone, rising 300% in 2020. And fraudsters are exploiting windows of opportunity in newer payment options like BOPIS, which suffers a 7% fraud attempt rate compared to 4.6% with other delivery models.
Oh, and embedded finance? The potential for loss there could prove just as staggering. With instant loans such as BNPL, customers receive goods before paying a dime—an irresistible lure for consumers and fraudsters alike.
Put together, this exacerbates what is already a perilous balancing act. On the one hand, you have a dark web awash with compromised credit card numbers, account login credentials, and more that can cost your organization millions. On the other, you have customers who have grown quite comfortable with digital transactions, but absolutely intolerant of even smallest amount of friction, let alone-step up challenges. As it stands now, as much as 88% of online purchases are abandoned—making smooth, seamless transactions a priority.
#5 Momentum Builds for Biometrics
To counter the rising threat from transaction fraud, look for a growing number of organizations to deploy new biometric payment and identification systems. Banks, brokerages, and credit card companies, for instance, leverage voice authentication to verify identity and reduce service time. And fingerprint, retinal, facial, or voice biometrics are core components of those SCA requirements in open banking regulations such as PSD2.
In a post-pandemic world, biometrics will take on new forms, as well. Amazon has already begun piloting a biometric POS system at Seattle-area Whole Foods stores that enables customers to make purchases by swiping their hand across a reader. And facial recognition technology is being used to help verify the ages and identities of consumers purchasing age-restricted goods such alcohol and cannabis from vending machines.
But while biometrics are becoming a crucial element of transaction security, they are not 100% fraud proof on their own. What can be scanned can be stolen, after all. Once a cybercriminal has a picture of someone’s finger, face, eye or anything else, they can easily gain access to accounts or credit. And while it remains to be seen what kind of damage can be wrought using deepfake voices, fingerprints, or faces, we do know even Apple’s vaunted biometrics measures haven’t always been fully hack proof. But as part of layered authentication that fights both fraud and friction, these technologies will have a major impact on payments trends in the months and years ahead.

Account Takeover Protection: Everything You Need to Know | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/account-takeover-protection,2022-01-07,"Account Takeover Protection: Everything You Need to Know
Wondering about account takeover protection? We explain what account takeover is, how it occurs, and how to protect your customers.
What Is Account Takeover Protection?
Account takeover occurs when a fraudster gains control of a legitimate account by obtaining the account owner’s personal information and then changing login credentials. The fraudster then uses this account to carry out unauthorized transactions. Account takeover protection refers to the steps taken to prevent this from occurring.
By using machine learning and data science, account takeover protection can stop fraudulent logins by detecting anomalous behavior and recognizing signs of fraud. Metrics such as device age, account age, location, and transaction history are just a few of the data points measured to prevent account takeover.
What Is Account Takeover?
Account takeover is when cybercriminals use stolen credentials to access a legitimate account without the owner’s consent. Fraudsters use ATO attacks to transfer funds, steal information, and take advantage of any permissions that an account may have.
These attacks can be difficult to detect since the account is legitimate and already trusted on the network or application. ATO attacks have become increasingly popular due to the simplicity of the attack and the low perception of risk to fraudsters.
In Q2 of 2021, account takeover fraud had risen for the third time in a row, increasing by 75.2%. Fraudsters take advantage of data breaches by purchasing account details on dark web marketplaces. With a little scripting knowledge, attackers can test thousands of stolen credentials until they get a successful login.
Without ATO protection in place, businesses leave their customers susceptible to fraud. Even if a company has not suffered a data breach, accounts can still be compromised through reused passwords, stolen devices, and brute-force attacks.
How Does Account Takeover Work?
Account takeover typically occurs when credentials are stolen in a data breach or through a phishing scam. When account details are stolen through a breach, those accounts are often sold on dark web marketplaces or simply dumped online for free.
Phishing scams work by tricking the user into entering their credentials into a fake website. These sites look identical to the legitimate brand they are impersonating but have different URL addresses.
Once the victim enters their information, fraudsters steal that information and then redirect the login to the real website. While data breaches tend to target everyone equally, phishing attacks can be highly targeted.
For example, attackers can perform an ATO on a CEO by crafting highly customized phishing messages. Without ATO protection, fraudsters can leverage the CEO’s privileged account to send money, access information, and even add trusted users to the account.
A few other methods of ATO include the following:
● Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Attackers intercept account details over unsecured wireless connections or deauthentication attacks.
● Mobile Banking Trojans: Malware places an invisible overlay on the login window of a financial website to steal login credentials.
● Spyware: Malicious software silently records keystrokes and sends that information back to the attacker.
● SIM Card Spoofing: Criminals trick mobile phone carriers to transfer the victim’s phone number to a new device. This allows the attacker to bypass some multi-factor authentication methods.
How to Prevent Account Takeover
Both businesses and consumers can do their part to protect themselves from ATO. Businesses should consider account takeover protection to shield their customers from attacks and protect their company assets from staff impersonation.
To prevent account takeover businesses should do the following:
● Implement account takeover protection.
● Educate staff and customers about account security and best practices.
● Enable two-factor authentication.
● Use business-grade antivirus software to stop spyware.
● Automatically take down phishing sites that impersonate your brand.
● Use a firewall or email gateway to remove phishing messages.
To prevent account takeover customers should do the following:
● Avoid reusing the same username and password.
● Use two-factor authentication whenever possible.
● Avoid clicking on suspicious links.
● Double-check the URL in the address bar to ensure the site you’re logging in to is real.
Account Takeover Protection
Account takeover protection is a form of fraud prevention that stops an attack before it can start. Modern account takeover protection uses machine learning to identify and block key indicators of fraudulent activity.
Machine learning models continuously study key indicators of account compromise and use that data to protect customer accounts. When a login attempt is deemed suspicious, that user is sent through a challenge flow that requires additional authentication.
This extra authentication step can be customized, but it typically comes in the form of a one-time password via text, email, or authenticator app. If the challenge is completed successfully, the login may proceed.
Products like Outseer Fraud Manager are designed to stop account takeover without impacting legitimate users. By leveraging a global data network and advanced data science, Outseer can identify the true identity of account logins with extreme accuracy. This not only helps keep customer accounts safe but improves overall customer experience and brand loyalty.

Adaptive Authentication: What Is It & How Does It Work? | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/adaptive-authentication,2022-03-11,"Adaptive Authentication: What Is It & How Does It Work?
Curious about adaptive authentication? We explain what adaptive authentication is, how it works, and how a risk-based approach can reduce friction for users.
What Is Adaptive Authentication?
Adaptive authentication is a method of setting up different levels of multi-factor authentication depending on the risk associated with a login or transaction. Factors may include the following:
· User account
· User location
· Attempted action
· Device details
· Behavioral tendencies
· Risk profile
These and other factors are used to assess the context of a login or transaction and help differentiate legitimate customers and users from malicious behavior. The goal of adaptive authentication is to protect user accounts from hijacking and to prevent transaction fraud by requiring additional authentication when data indicates suspicious behavior.
Adaptive Authentication vs. Standard Authentication
The main difference between adaptive authentication and standard authentication is that adaptive authentication changes in line with user behavior to prevent fraud and account takeovers, not legitimate transactions.
Standard authentication simply looks for the correct username and password combination, while adaptive (or risk-based) authentication also looks at login location, device ID, number of failed logins, payment details, and dozens of other key data points.
Together these data points are used to generate an overall risk score for a login or transaction. If the risk is high, the user has to authenticate through another method such as two-factor authentication.
A few actions that could trigger adaptive authentication include the following:
● A high number of failed login attempts
● Login attempt from a new device
● Login attempt from an unknown IP address or location
● Changes to username or password
● Behavior that indicates a script is attempting the login rather than a human
Adaptive authentication is flexible and allows organizations to set their own risk scores based on their business objectives and risk tolerance. For instance, a customer mistyping their password once on a known device wouldn’t trigger a lockout or require additional steps.
However, a login from a new device in a different country would certainly raise some red flags and require the user to provide additional authentication to prove who they are.
By using adaptive authentication, organizations can protect their privileged accounts from compromise and safeguard their customer accounts from cybercriminals.
Why Do We Need Adaptive Authentication?
Even when a user does everything right, their credit card numbers, username, password and other details can still be stolen or compromised through a data breach. Websites that store credentials are continuously under attack by cybercriminals who sell stolen data in dark web marketplaces.
According to the Aite-Novarica Group, CNP fraud loss could top $17.2 billion by 2023. Meanwhile, account takeovers (ATOs) fueled by data breaches increased 850% between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021.
At the same time, customer expectations for instant, uninterrupted interactions and transactions
grow by the nanosecond. And many banks, card issuers, merchants, and others are challenged to meet and exceed these expectations while preventing fraud that can cost them millions.
The drivers for these forms of fraud include the following:
Stolen Accounts on the Dark Web
Criminals can buy thousands of stolen credit card numbers or login credentials for mere pennies each, and try their luck at breaking into accounts. With a simple script, an attacker can test thousands of credentials in a matter of minutes to see which accounts are still vulnerable.
Organizations without adaptive authentication will fail to see an attacker has access and only see a successful login or transaction. Even worse, criminals infiltrating corporate systems or email accounts can cross-reference archived messages or passwords to find additional services they can exploit to appear even more convincing.
It doesn’t help that many people use the same passwords for multiple accounts—including banking, retail, utilities, social media, and more. It also doesn’t help that they also tend to use easily deduced variations of the same 10 passwords.
Phishing Scams
Phishing scams are a leading cause of account compromise. Phishing is a fraudster creating fake messages from a trusted person or brand in an effort to trick the victim into entering their account information.
For example, fraudsters can send emails that look like an exact copy of a Microsoft Office password reset request or past-due notice from Comcast. When the victim clicks the link they are sent to a fake password reset page that looks identical to the real thing. If the user enters their information, it’s sent directly to the attacker.
According to the Federal Trade commission, phishing scams led to $5.8 billion in consumer losses in 2021— a 70% increase year-over-year.
Benefits of Adaptive Authentication
Adaptive authentication can prevent account compromise and fraudulent purchases by understanding the behavior behind a login rather than just relying on the correct username and password.
Adaptive authentication also offers other benefits such as the following:
● Frictionless Authentication: Legitimate customers and staff are not slowed down or asked to authenticate again.
● Continuous Improvement: Machine learning continuously learns from case management feedback, authentication results, and other intelligence to better distinguish friend from foe—meaning your system naturally improves over time.
● Customizable Risk Scores: Organizations can tailor their adaptive authentication to balance their risk tolerance across different applications and products.
How Adaptive Authentication Works
Adaptive authentication works by collecting data on each user to understand their baseline behavior and other details. This can include what devices they use, where they log in from, payment information, and what their typical behavior is inside an application.
Machine learning works in the background to continuously collect data and calculates the probability of an event being fraudulent, given the known factors associated with a user and account.
When paired with modern data science, machine learning can take all factors into account and weight them according to relevance—adaptive authentication incredibly accurate and effective. Over time these algorithms learn from users and only require additional authentication when absolutely necessary.
Machine learning models can be trained to identify specific threats and tap into other shared data sources to get smarter each day. The scale and speed at which these systems operate rival any manual detection a human could ever do.
Each unusual or suspicious behavior adds to the overall risk score for the login or transaction attempt. Only when the scant few interactions or transactions that warrant additional scrutiny will prompt the user to authenticate through a challenge flow.
Secondary authentication can be customized by the organization with many different options:
● SMS verification
● Email verification
● Authenticator app
● FIDO U2F tokens
● Biometrics authentication (voice ID, fingerprint scan, etc.)
Organizations can also choose to add additional adaptive authentication measures to specific user groups, departments, roles, or activities.
For instance, if a user wants to change their banking information, the system could always require secondary authentication to continue. This is optional but helps demonstrate the flexibility that adaptive authentication offers.
How to Set Up Adaptive Authentication
Adaptive authentication relies on complex data science, machine learning algorithms, and global data networks to function. Organizations use third-party providers to integrate adaptive authentication into their businesses.
Organizations can choose from a number of step-up authentication methods for each of their products and tailor their authentication to reflect their risk tolerance and business objectives.
When choosing a partner for your adaptive authentication, look for the following features:
● Frictionless flow authentication
● Powered by machine learning
● Simple policy management
● A global intelligence network
● Case management options for manual investigation

Adaptive Authentication: What Is It & How Does It Work?
Curious about adaptive authentication? We explain what adaptive authentication is, how it works, and how a risk-based approach can reduce friction for users.
What Is Adaptive Authentication?
Adaptive authentication is a method of setting up different levels of multi-factor authentication depending on the risk associated with a login or transaction. Factors may include the following:
· User account
· User location
· Attempted action
· Device details
· Behavioral tendencies
· Risk profile
These and other factors are used to assess the context of a login or transaction and help differentiate legitimate customers and users from malicious behavior. The goal of adaptive authentication is to protect user accounts from hijacking and to prevent transaction fraud by requiring additional authentication when data indicates suspicious behavior.
Adaptive Authentication vs. Standard Authentication
The main difference between adaptive authentication and standard authentication is that adaptive authentication changes in line with user behavior to prevent fraud and account takeovers, not legitimate transactions.
Standard authentication simply looks for the correct username and password combination, while adaptive (or risk-based) authentication also looks at login location, device ID, number of failed logins, payment details, and dozens of other key data points.
Together these data points are used to generate an overall risk score for a login or transaction. If the risk is high, the user has to authenticate through another method such as two-factor authentication.
A few actions that could trigger adaptive authentication include the following:
● A high number of failed login attempts
● Login attempt from a new device
● Login attempt from an unknown IP address or location
● Changes to username or password
● Behavior that indicates a script is attempting the login rather than a human
Adaptive authentication is flexible and allows organizations to set their own risk scores based on their business objectives and risk tolerance. For instance, a customer mistyping their password once on a known device wouldn’t trigger a lockout or require additional steps.
However, a login from a new device in a different country would certainly raise some red flags and require the user to provide additional authentication to prove who they are.
By using adaptive authentication, organizations can protect their privileged accounts from compromise and safeguard their customer accounts from cybercriminals.
Why Do We Need Adaptive Authentication?
Even when a user does everything right, their credit card numbers, username, password and other details can still be stolen or compromised through a data breach. Websites that store credentials are continuously under attack by cybercriminals who sell stolen data in dark web marketplaces.
According to the Aite-Novarica Group, CNP fraud loss could top $17.2 billion by 2023. Meanwhile, account takeovers (ATOs) fueled by data breaches increased 850% between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021.
At the same time, customer expectations for instant, uninterrupted interactions and transactions
grow by the nanosecond. And many banks, card issuers, merchants, and others are challenged to meet and exceed these expectations while preventing fraud that can cost them millions.
The drivers for these forms of fraud include the following:
Stolen Accounts on the Dark Web
Criminals can buy thousands of stolen credit card numbers or login credentials for mere pennies each, and try their luck at breaking into accounts. With a simple script, an attacker can test thousands of credentials in a matter of minutes to see which accounts are still vulnerable.
Organizations without adaptive authentication will fail to see an attacker has access and only see a successful login or transaction. Even worse, criminals infiltrating corporate systems or email accounts can cross-reference archived messages or passwords to find additional services they can exploit to appear even more convincing.
It doesn’t help that many people use the same passwords for multiple accounts—including banking, retail, utilities, social media, and more. It also doesn’t help that they also tend to use easily deduced variations of the same 10 passwords.
Phishing Scams
Phishing scams are a leading cause of account compromise. Phishing is a fraudster creating fake messages from a trusted person or brand in an effort to trick the victim into entering their account information.
For example, fraudsters can send emails that look like an exact copy of a Microsoft Office password reset request or past-due notice from Comcast. When the victim clicks the link they are sent to a fake password reset page that looks identical to the real thing. If the user enters their information, it’s sent directly to the attacker.
According to the Federal Trade commission, phishing scams led to $5.8 billion in consumer losses in 2021— a 70% increase year-over-year.
Benefits of Adaptive Authentication
Adaptive authentication can prevent account compromise and fraudulent purchases by understanding the behavior behind a login rather than just relying on the correct username and password.
Adaptive authentication also offers other benefits such as the following:
● Frictionless Authentication: Legitimate customers and staff are not slowed down or asked to authenticate again.
● Continuous Improvement: Machine learning continuously learns from case management feedback, authentication results, and other intelligence to better distinguish friend from foe—meaning your system naturally improves over time.
● Customizable Risk Scores: Organizations can tailor their adaptive authentication to balance their risk tolerance across different applications and products.
How Adaptive Authentication Works
Adaptive authentication works by collecting data on each user to understand their baseline behavior and other details. This can include what devices they use, where they log in from, payment information, and what their typical behavior is inside an application.
Machine learning works in the background to continuously collect data and calculates the probability of an event being fraudulent, given the known factors associated with a user and account.
When paired with modern data science, machine learning can take all factors into account and weight them according to relevance—adaptive authentication incredibly accurate and effective. Over time these algorithms learn from users and only require additional authentication when absolutely necessary.
Machine learning models can be trained to identify specific threats and tap into other shared data sources to get smarter each day. The scale and speed at which these systems operate rival any manual detection a human could ever do.
Each unusual or suspicious behavior adds to the overall risk score for the login or transaction attempt. Only when the scant few interactions or transactions that warrant additional scrutiny will prompt the user to authenticate through a challenge flow.
Secondary authentication can be customized by the organization with many different options:
● SMS verification
● Email verification
● Authenticator app
● FIDO U2F tokens
● Biometrics authentication (voice ID, fingerprint scan, etc.)
Organizations can also choose to add additional adaptive authentication measures to specific user groups, departments, roles, or activities.
For instance, if a user wants to change their banking information, the system could always require secondary authentication to continue. This is optional but helps demonstrate the flexibility that adaptive authentication offers.
How to Set Up Adaptive Authentication
Adaptive authentication relies on complex data science, machine learning algorithms, and global data networks to function. Organizations use third-party providers to integrate adaptive authentication into their businesses.
Organizations can choose from a number of step-up authentication methods for each of their products and tailor their authentication to reflect their risk tolerance and business objectives.
When choosing a partner for your adaptive authentication, look for the following features:
● Frictionless flow authentication
● Powered by machine learning
● Simple policy management
● A global intelligence network
● Case management options for manual investigation

Aspen Report: A National Strategy to Prevent Scams | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/aspen-report-a-national-strategy-to-prevent-scams,2025-10-29,"Aspen Report: A National Strategy to Prevent Scams
Aspen Institute Calls for Whole-of-Ecosystem Coordinated Attack on Consumer Scam Prevention
Consumer scams are escalating into a national security and economic crisis. In response, the Aspen Institute has issued a landmark report outlining a comprehensive national scam prevention strategy, calling for a whole-of-ecosystem approach across government, industry, and civil society.
The report emphasizes that effective scam prevention requires close coordination between the U.S. government, state authorities, and private sector leaders to share intelligence, strengthen defenses, and disrupt organized fraud networks.
In this article, fraud prevention expert, Ken Palla covers:
- An overview of the Aspen Institute’s new recommendations on national scam prevention and why they matter.
- The U.S. government’s role in leading a coordinated anti-scam strategy.
- State and local responsibilities for scam prevention training and victim support.
- Private sector obligations to detect and report scam activity, including banks, telecoms, and digital platforms.
- The need for a national “duty of care” framework and safe harbor provisions.
- Examples of early industry action, including initiatives by AARP, Visa, and major banks.
- Why a whole-of-ecosystem approach to scam prevention is essential to protect consumers and restore trust.
The Aspen Institute has released recommendations on fighting consumer scams in the U.S. This initiative will drive the U.S. government and the private sector to take serious action to help fight consumer scams. Consumer scams are a national security threat, and the U.S. needs to aggressively fight this threat.
For my foreign fraud fighter friends, many of these recommendations will be applicable for your country as well. In some cases, these recommendations have already been successfully deployed in several countries.
This report was the result of thousands of hours of work, with over 300 experts from 80 organizations meeting over the past year. The report contains 47 principle-based recommendations and over 100 practical next steps.
Goal of the Recommendations
The goal of these recommendations is to create a “national anti-scam strategy (that) should help strengthen defenses in sectors that scammers target or exploit, including telecommunications, messaging, digital platforms (social media, paid advertising, and retail), and financial services (banking, payments, fintech, crypto).”
The Aspen Institute acknowledges that consumer scams are a U.S. national security threat because of who the scammers are—organized crime, Mexican cartels, Triad gangs—and the amount of money stolen per year. Reported losses exceed $16 billion annually but are likely significantly underreported.
Key Recommendations:
- Congress and the White House should recognize scams as a national security threat.
- Corporate leaders must act decisively to suppress scam activity at every stage of its lifecycle. This includes maintaining robust anti-scam policies and detecting and disrupting scams in process.
- There should be active data information sharing, tracking, and measurement of consumer scams.
Role of the U.S. Government to Lead a National Anti-Scam Strategy
The recommendations put heavy emphasis on the U.S. government to “elevate scam prevention as a national priority” and to establish a national strategy to combat consumer scams.
The government is also being asked to help shut down the criminal organizations that perpetrate these scams. This will require cross-border coordination with many countries. Several nations are already participating in coordinated efforts to eliminate scam centers and related criminal organizations.
The U.S. government is further asked to facilitate scam data sharing between the various organizations that should be fighting consumer scams. Currently, there are limitations to sharing data among banks, telcos, digital platforms, and law enforcement. Cross-sector data sharing is a critical component of this anti-scam strategy.
Missing National Consumer Duty of Care
The Aspen Institute recognizes, “There is no clear or consistent national ‘duty of care’ to suppress scam activity across sectors targeted by scammers, such as telecommunications, messaging, digital platforms (social media, paid advertising, and retail), and financial services (banking, payments, fintech, crypto).”
According to the Aspen report, this needs to change to “establish clearer duties for companies to prevent scam activity, coupled with an improved set of rights (safe harbors) and authorities that enable them to act decisively.”
The U.S. government can address this through regulation, or companies can add voluntary anti-scam strategies and controls. Certain safe harbor provisions to support this “duty of care” would, however, typically require government regulation or legislation.
Role of States and Local Governments
The states are pivotal in the fight against consumer scams. They need trained and “scam-focused” law enforcement to be able to interact with consumers when they report crimes and ask for help in recovering stolen funds.
Too often, local police are not trained in consumer scams. Not every local police department has the resources to be the primary contact.
This is where states need to define overall law enforcement training and offer a triage approach for victims in smaller counties. For example, a state the size of Montana, with just over one million people, might have one center with experts to support consumer victims.
See Table 1 for some of the key recommendations.
Role of the Private Sector
Telcos, digital platforms, and banks are where scammers use their facilities—text messages, dating site interactions, bogus investment ads, and money movement—to execute scams.
The Aspen report acknowledges this and recommends that these sectors adopt a formal anti-scam policy and strategy. It also strongly recommends “know your customer” controls to prevent scammers from:
- Sending scam text messages to consumers
- Interacting with unsuspecting members of dating sites
- Selling goods on marketplaces
- Posting scam investment ads
- Creating money mule accounts (the receiving side of a scam transaction)
There are additional controls mentioned for each sector. Some of these are included in Table 1.
When the report discusses states and the private sector, there is a clear emphasis on scam prevention.
Table 1. Key Recommended Actions by Sector
What Action Is Occurring in the Private Sector?
For the Aspen Institute’s recommendations to have real impact, the U.S. government, states, and the private sector must commit to these requirements and demonstrate measurable action.
Axios reported several positive developments this year:
“AARP stood up a new Fraud Watch Network earlier this year, which offers a free helpline for people who have been targeted by scams and connects them with law enforcement as needed.”
“Visa, another member, created its own internal scam detection practice this year that proactively hunts and takes down scams on its own payment networks and beyond.”
Some banks have also established dedicated anti-scam departments focused solely on consumer scams. Others have begun tracking scam incidents to raise executive-level awareness of the problem.
The call to action is clear: the private sector must become fully engaged in fighting consumer scams, beginning at the CEO level.
Closing: Urgent Action is Required
The consumer scam problem is massive in the U.S. and around the world. The Global Anti-Scam Alliance estimates worldwide losses may reach $1 trillion. These scams are driven by transnational organized crime, including large scam compounds in Southeast Asia with 100,000 to 300,000 scammers.
This requires urgent action:
- The U.S. government needs to treat this as a national security issue and establish national leadership to fight consumer scams.
- The government must work to disrupt scam operations.
- Regulation and legislation should require banks, telcos, and digital platforms to have anti-scam policies and strategies in place. Cross-sector data sharing should be enabled, with proper safe harbor protections for reasonable actions taken by these sectors.
- States must increase law enforcement support to address consumer scams and make AAMVA data available across all states. Crypto ATMs should be banned.
- Banks, credit unions, fintechs, telcos, and digital platforms need to establish anti-scam strategies with meaningful controls that can reduce consumer scams.
We need a whole-of-ecosystem approach to fight consumer scams and protect American consumers. The private sector can begin taking action now while federal and state governments determine their roles.
After all, it is private sector customers who are being scammed and losing billions. A lack of serious private sector action could shift the issue from prevention to regulatory liability considerations.

Learn more about the latest enhancements in biometric protections to continue preventing account takeover attacks.
Let’s just say the fraudsters have it coming. As Outseer rolls out new identity-based enhancements to protect against account takeover (ATO) attacks and account enrollment fraud, I won’t lie to you: It always feels good to implement new ways to put the squeeze on cybercriminal organizations.
Just look at the numbers. Account takeover (ATO) attacks now account for more than $16 billion in annual losses in the just US alone. Account enrollment fraud using compromised identity information contributes to another $56 billion in losses each year. And according to the FBI, at least $6 billion of that can be attributed to the use of synthetic identities—one of the fastest-growing financial crimes in the US.
In other words, the latest enhancements to Outseer Fraud Manager couldn’t come a moment too soon. Powered by machine learning, data science, and real-time risk scoring, Outseer Fraud Manager protects logins and transactions originating from digital user accounts with a 95% fraud prevention rate and just 5% intervention.
That’s the best performance in the industry. And it’s predicated on our belief that setting up or accessing an account should be absolutely seamless for legitimate users, and that step-up challenges should be reserved for only the scan few that warrant further scrutiny. By transparently authenticating users behind the scenes, we prevent fraudulent access or activity before it happens—while reducing user friction.
And now, we’re layering in additional, biometric capabilities to help banks, merchants, and others further protect the end-to-end user journey while delivering a fast, friendly user experience. Enhancements include:
Effortless ID Verification at Enrollment
Outseer Fraud Manager customers can now enroll users into new digital services, leveraging biometric facial detection capabilities to prevent fraudsters from opening new accounts with stolen or synthetic identity information. The technology powering this capability validates a live human face against a government-issued ID, and facilitates document verification against third-party databases.
Kicking Account Compromise to the Curb
This same facial recognition tech can be leveraged for even stronger controls against account compromise attempts. Among other things, this solution leverages FIDO2 compliant biometrics for strong authentication in case of a high-risk transaction or digital activity. Also very cool: It allows passwordless authentication to be selected as the primary method of authentication during sign up. Given the fact that the typical person has 100 different passwords to lose or forget, this will be as welcome as it is fraud-proof.
Outseer Beyond™: Building Momentum
Together, these enhancements are just the latest example of the Outseer Beyond™ partner program in action. Through this ecosystem, third-party providers help expand the scope and reach of our ant-fraud products to a worldwide customer and partner community.
This is also just the latest marker in our mission to liberate the world of transactional fraud. As adoption of digital channels continues to accelerate, we’ll be there to help organizations easily distinguish between friend and foe—while erasing user friction. Like I said, the fraudsters have it coming.","Outseer's blog post announces new identity-based and biometric enhancements to Outseer Fraud Manager, designed to combat account takeover and enrollment fraud.

How do they work? Continue reading to learn how to recognize one and protect yourself from these scams.
Lately there has been a new phishing trend where one url is creating thousands of phishing pages targeting many brands and customers. These new phishing attacks are created in a few seconds, and due to their quantity, are very difficult to take down.
1. The Redirection URL
For this attack to work, all parameters must be included in the URL. If only the domain is present it will generate a false 404 page. These URLs’ domains are all registered on Alibaba’s web services, and Google web hosting.
Thus, a working URL would look something like:
somedomain.top/ee11UX5BR1RkRHRnZEMIWBg1JnFVfVV4aQEgc1UkGxolUA8gSj83D0g_?cyr1636280111876
The website will then try to load a series of bots named anti1.php, anti2.php, etc. located at
/home/ somedomain /public_html/secure.alpha.gr2/index.php
The .top domain would retain the phished credentials from the attack at [domain].top/T_a_n_G_u_l_AR/alpha.txt
The bots would then forward the request to a remote address of a newly generated domain.
2. The Redirection
From this URL, a new domain is created to generate and host the new phishing attack on the middle redirect URL. From this example, the following page would look like:
http://7xhvqvpy.cn/eG4qV883/somedomain/static/sur.css
or
http://dmzyewzh.cn/8wLei2wf/somedomain/static/sur.css and other similar URLs.
This domain is on Cloudflare’s services in order to obfuscate the attack and keep fraud investigation at bay. The registrant’s information ties each of these domains back to peacchi@163.com, being created on March 18 2021. For example this domain:
Without the full URL, the attack will redirect elsewhere to a malicious website request to use notifications from the site. This is again to prevent investigation on the attack. The URL must be the same one as created in phase 1 or it will not work appropriately.
3. The Final Stage
Lastly, the attack loads the intended phishing page. In this example the URL is
http://7xhvqvpy.cn/eG4qV883/somedomain/?_t=1636993722wmx#1636993736735
The numbers in the parameter section of the URL changes with each time the page is refreshed, never leaving the exact same URL.

Payments Fraud: 3 Best Practices for Cybersecurity Awareness Month & Beyond | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/best-practices-cybersecurity-awareness,2021-10-25,"Payments Fraud: 3 Best Practices for Cybersecurity Awareness Month & Beyond
Learn how to be protected this holiday season and all year long with these cybersecurity best practices.
Happy Halloween: Letting Cybersecurity Awareness Month go by without implementing five best practices for protecting against payments fraud could lead to some pretty frightening results for your business and its customers.
I mean, sure, the awareness campaign and its #BeCyberSmart hashtag are cringy as hell. And yes, every month should be cybersecurity awareness month. But given it heralds the start of the all-important fourth quarter and is known for putting spine-chilling threats top of mind, October is the perfect time to take in the best ways to scare off fraudsters.
The bloodsuckers have it coming to them. Global losses from card-not-present (CNP) fraud alone topped $6.4 billion in 2020—and could increase another 16.4% by year’s end. Meanwhile, account takeover (ATO) attacks accounted for another $16 billion in loss in just the U.S. last year, up 300% from 2019. It doesn’t help that 68% of Americans use the same password across multiple accounts.
As reported in our latest fraud trends report, there are a handful of key best practices that can de-fang fraudsters. Here are three that rise to the top:
#1 Define Your Fraud and Risk Management Strategy
Ideally, defenses should be erected to protect all digital channels and current payment types. They should also provide flexibility to support various digital commerce models such as buy online, pick up in-store (BOPIS) and buy on mobile, pick-up curbside. According to PYMNTS.com, fraud in these channels rose 6% in the first quarter of 2021, with the average transaction value up 4.7%. The best solutions will provide proven capabilities for detecting and prevent fraud while maintaining a seamless transaction experience for cardholders.
#2 Employ Multiple Layers
Given all the channels, locations, and devices your customers use to do business with you, it’s important to protect every step in the customer journey. There is no “foolproof” solution. You need to mitigate every possible attack vector, including brand abuse, phishing, and rogue mobile apps, with the appropriate tools to protect your customers from falling prey to credentials harvesting attacks—and your brand from being blamed for it. According to Outseer researchers, phishing accounted for more than 1-in-5 attacks in the second quarter of the year. And the number of imposter apps from trusted sources such as Apple’s App Store, the Google Play store and others surged 66% in just 90 days.
#3 Take a Risk-based Approach
For organizations executing a balanced strategy of risk and experience, it pays to protect transactions with risk-based authentication. One of the most significant improvements in the latest EMV® 3-D Secure protocol is the incorporation of risk-based approach—one that I’m proud to say we’ve been pioneering for over a decade. It allows legitimate cardholders to transact without any added friction, improving trust and loyalty while step-up authentication options kick in for only those few, higher-risk transactions that warrant additional scrutiny. According to a new study from Aite-Novarica Group and Outseer, e-commerce transactions made using 3-D Secure achieved 85% or higher authorization rates, helping to suppress both fraud and customer attrition rates significantly.
Hobbling Goblins—and the Grinch
These three top recommendations are just the beginning. For all 5 of our best practices for Cybersecurity Awareness Month, check out our Q3 2021 Fraud & Payments Report.
Your holiday says may thank you for it. With Home Depot and others selling out Halloween decorations—as far back as August—analysts predict a very merry holiday selling season for merchants and the credit card and payments providers who serve them. Deloitte forecasts US holiday e-commerce sales will grow as much as 15% year-over-year to reach $218 billion this year.
But that’s only if they can keep payments fraud from making off with their holiday haul. With Cybersecurity Awareness Month coming to a close, Halloween is high time to start taking a broomstick to the bad guys.

"BNPL Fraud: ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ a Hit With Consumers–and Cybercriminals | Outseer",https://www.outseer.com/blog/bnpl-fraud,2021-11-23,"BNPL Fraud: ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ a Hit With Consumers–and Cybercriminals
Protect yourself this holiday season. Learn the setbacks this digital form of layaway can have
As the all-important holiday shopping season gets underway, “Buy Now Pay Later” (BNPL) apps and services are catching fire with consumers—as well as the fraudsters who prey on them. But who’ll get left holding the bag?
BNPL platforms like Afterpay, Affirm, Sezzle and Flex have helped merchants and others hit pay dirt by enabling consumers to instantly buy everything from gaming consoles and booze to rent and utilities, and then pay it off in split monthly payments—often interest free. A kind of digital age twist on the age-old layaway, BNPL surged right along with the coronavirus as consumers shifted many purchases to digital channels amid the pandemic.
And it hasn’t stopped since. According to Forbes, BNPL purchases are expected to climb 75% for full-year 2021, to nearly $100 billion in just the US. And Apple, PayPal, and others are betting big that BNPL will turbocharge brick-and-mortar purchases as well.
But none of this comes without risk, of course. Already, as much as a third of US consumers who have used Buy Now, Pay Later services have fallen behind on one or more payments, with 72% seeing their credit card score decline. And now, fraudsters are increasingly finding clever ways to exploit this innovative form of financing.
All Trust, Not Enough Verify?
With instant loans such as BNPL, the potential for loss was always going to be high. For one thing, customers receive goods before paying a dime—making it an irresistible lure for consumers and fraudsters alike.
According to CNBC, cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging stolen login credentials to hijack BNPL-enabled accounts, leaving the unsuspecting victim to pay the bill. They’re also finding ways to game the BNPL account enrollment process to defraud companies. As it turns out, some firms don’t conduct formal credit checks at enrollment, instead “relying on internal algorithms to determine creditworthiness based on the information they have available to them.”
That’s all kinds of bad news—just look at the numbers. Account takeover (ATO) attacks now account for more than $16 billion in annual loss in the US alone. And account enrollment fraud using compromised identity information to gain access to personal loans contributes to a whopping $57 billion in annual losses. According to the FBI, at least $6 billion of that can be attributed to the use of synthetic identities, which is least likely to be flagged by traditional measures and constitutes one of the fastest financial crimes in the US.
That could prove disastrous if better protections aren’t put in place as adoption—and use for things like rent and big-ticket items—continues to grow.
Putting the Kibosh on BNPL Fraudsters
Tackling these issues won’t be easy, but anti-fraud solutions employing machine learning and shared global intelligence can dramatically reduce fraud loss that stems from them.
Let’s look at our own anti-fraud product as an example. Powered by machine learning, data science, and real-time data from more than 6,000 partners spanning virtually every industry and geography, Outseer Fraud Manager protects account logins, enrollments, transactions, and more.
By transparently authenticating users behind the scenes, we prevent fraudulent access or activity before it happens, providing a seamless, frictionless flow for legitimate users while reserving step-up verifications for the very few transactions, logins, or other activities that are truly high-risk. In fact, Outseer prevents 95% of all fraud loss with a small 5% intervention rate. That’s the best performance in the industry.
Those seeking an extra layer of protection can also enroll new account holders using biometric facial detection capabilities to prevent fraudsters from opening new accounts with stolen or synthetic identity information. The technology powering this capability leverages FIDO2-compliant biometric facial detection to validate a live human face against a government-issued ID, and facilities document verification against third-party databases.
Holiday 2021: Ho, Ho, Ho—or the Grinch Who Stole Christmas?
Concerns over BNPL are emerging at a critical time with Black Friday kicking off the season this week. BNPL platforms, FSIs, and their merchant customers will be tempted to throttle back fraud protections during what’s expected to be a $1.1 trillion bonanza in the US this year.
Let’s all hope savvier organizations embrace technologies that enable them to enhance the enrollment and transaction experience for legitimate shoppers—while keeping BPNL fraud at bay.
To learn how Outseer Fraud Manager can protect against BNPL fraud stemming from account takeovers and new enrollment fraud, schedule a demo today.","The rise of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services is attracting cybercriminals who exploit vulnerabilities in the system, such as weak credit checks and stolen login credentials, leading to significant fraud losses.

Protecting against BNPL fraud is especially crucial during the holiday shopping season when transaction volumes are high and fraudsters are more active.","account takeover, credit card, fraud",3,2021-11-23,"BNPL Fraud: ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ a Hit With Consumers–and Cybercriminals | Outseer. BNPL Fraud: ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ a Hit With Consumers–and Cybercriminals
Protect yourself this holiday season. Learn the setbacks this digital form of layaway can have
As the all-important holiday shopping season gets underway, “Buy Now Pay Later” (BNPL) apps and services are catching fire with consumers—as well as the fraudsters who prey on them. But who’ll get left holding the bag?
BNPL platforms like Afterpay, Affirm, Sezzle and Flex have helped merchants and others hit pay dirt by enabling consumers to instantly buy everything from gaming consoles and booze to rent and utilities, and then pay it off in split monthly payments—often interest free. A kind of digital age twist on the age-old layaway, BNPL surged right along with the coronavirus as consumers shifted many purchases to digital channels amid the pandemic.
And it hasn’t stopped since. According to Forbes, BNPL purchases are expected to climb 75% for full-year 2021, to nearly $100 billion in just the US. And Apple, PayPal, and others are betting big that BNPL will turbocharge brick-and-mortar purchases as well.
But none of this comes without risk, of course. Already, as much as a third of US consumers who have used Buy Now, Pay Later services have fallen behind on one or more payments, with 72% seeing their credit card score decline. And now, fraudsters are increasingly finding clever ways to exploit this innovative form of financing.
All Trust, Not Enough Verify?
With instant loans such as BNPL, the potential for loss was always going to be high. For one thing, customers receive goods before paying a dime—making it an irresistible lure for consumers and fraudsters alike.
According to CNBC, cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging stolen login credentials to hijack BNPL-enabled accounts, leaving the unsuspecting victim to pay the bill. They’re also finding ways to game the BNPL account enrollment process to defraud companies. As it turns out, some firms don’t conduct formal credit checks at enrollment, instead “relying on internal algorithms to determine creditworthiness based on the information they have available to them.”
That’s all kinds of bad news—just look at the numbers. Account takeover (ATO) attacks now account for more than $16 billion in annual loss in the US alone. And account enrollment fraud using compromised identity information to gain access to personal loans contributes to a whopping $57 billion in annual losses. According to the FBI, at least $6 billion of that can be attributed to the use of synthetic identities, which is least likely to be flagged by traditional measures and constitutes one of the fastest financial crimes in the US.
That could prove disastrous if better protections aren’t put in place as adoption—and use for things like rent and big-ticket items—continues to grow.
Putting the Kibosh on BNPL Fraudsters
Tackling these issues won’t be easy, but anti-fraud solutions employing machine learning and shared global intelligence can dramatically reduce fraud loss that stems from them.
Let’s look at our own anti-fraud product as an example. Powered by machine learning, data science, and real-time data from more than 6,000 partners spanning virtually every industry and geography, Outseer Fraud Manager protects account logins, enrollments, transactions, and more.
By transparently authenticating users behind the scenes, we prevent fraudulent access or activity before it happens, providing a seamless, frictionless flow for legitimate users while reserving step-up verifications for the very few transactions, logins, or other activities that are truly high-risk. In fact, Outseer prevents 95% of all fraud loss with a small 5% intervention rate. That’s the best performance in the industry.
Those seeking an extra layer of protection can also enroll new account holders using biometric facial detection capabilities to prevent fraudsters from opening new accounts with stolen or synthetic identity information. The technology powering this capability leverages FIDO2-compliant biometric facial detection to validate a live human face against a government-issued ID, and facilities document verification against third-party databases.
Holiday 2021: Ho, Ho, Ho—or the Grinch Who Stole Christmas?
Concerns over BNPL are emerging at a critical time with Black Friday kicking off the season this week. BNPL platforms, FSIs, and their merchant customers will be tempted to throttle back fraud protections during what’s expected to be a $1.1 trillion bonanza in the US this year.
Let’s all hope savvier organizations embrace technologies that enable them to enhance the enrollment and transaction experience for legitimate shoppers—while keeping BPNL fraud at bay.

Buy Now, Pay Later is taking off – and the scams are following close behind. Read more on how you can use Outseer to prevent being a BNPL fraud victim.
If you think 2021 was a blockbuster year for Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL), just wait until you see the sequel.
But fair warning: Fraudsters already have a front-row seat.
Over the past year, platforms such as Afterpay, Affirm, Sezzle, and Klarna have helped consumers make $100 billion in purchases for everything from PlayStations to pet food to insurance premiums. That’s a $76 billion increase in just 12 months. And there are no signs of slowing down.
Today, nearly every US retailer from Target to Big Lots to American Eagle offers BNPL options, which typically allow customers to pay for purchases in fixed installments, often with zero interest. According to Insider Intelligence, global Buy Now, Pay Later spend is set to hit $680 billion in volume by 2025.
As PYMNTS reports, merchants, banks, and even card issuers are actively expanding into new forms of BNPL for wealthy consumers and even B2B financing. In the inflationary moment we’re living through, this could accelerate BNPL’s growth beyond even the most bullish of estimates.
Unfortunately, cybercriminals have noticed—and see plenty of opportunity to achieve exponential growth of their own.
BNPL: A Fraudster’s Paradise?
As BNPL installment usage explodes, fraudsters are flocking to channels like Telegram to offer tips on infiltrating BNPL customer accounts using compromised login credentials in order to go on illicit shopping sprees. To hear victims tell it, BNPL account takeover (ATO) attacks can be far more ruinous—emotionally and financially—than many realize.
What’s more, fraudsters are also leveraging synthetic identity information to hijack the BNPL enrollment process in order to defraud merchants and other companies directly.
According to the FBI, synthetic identity fraud is a $6 billion problem that the FBI calls one of the fastest-growing forms of financial crime. And ATO fraud growth has been fueled by the surge in data breaches in recent years, increasing 850% between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021, according to studies from Sift.
That figure is likely to climb—and the reputational damage to BNPL service providers and their customers could be disastrous.
Enormous Opportunity, Profound Risks
All these data points about BNPL growth rates can mask another reason this innovative form of finance is set to boom. Today, BNPL still accounts for just a small percentage of retail sales—which suggests the potential for enormous growth for years to come. Unfortunately, that’s also true of fraud.
Cyberthieves are just getting started in this space. Card-not-present (CNP) fraud accounts for over half of all gross fraud losses worldwide—despite hardened defenses and highly-regulated credit practices. According to the Aite-Novarica Group, loss from CNP fraud is expected to top $17.2 billion by 2023.
In an environment like this, BNPL could get bludgeoned by ever-more sophisticated attacks. In order to protect themselves, organizations across the BNPL ecosystem will need to implement defenses against new risks and evolving attack modalities beyond traditional CNP fraud—without sacrificing convenience and choice for consumers.
The good news: Help is on the way.

Building a Zero Trust Strategy: A Fundamental Guide | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/building-a-zero-trust-strategy-a-fundamental-guide,2023-06-13,"Building a Zero Trust Strategy: A Fundamental Guide
Introduction
In today’s digital landscape, traditional security measures are no longer sufficient to protect sensitive data and systems from evolving cyber threats. As organizations face an increasing number of sophisticated attacks, the Zero Trust concept has emerged as a proactive security approach. By adopting a Zero Trust strategy, businesses can enhance their defenses and minimize the potential impact of security breaches. In this blog post, we will explore the fundamentals of creating a Zero Trust strategy and provide actionable steps to help organizations implement this security framework effectively.
Understanding Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security framework that challenges the conventional perimeter-based approach. Instead of assuming trust based on network location, Zero Trust promotes the “never trust, always verify” concept. Every user, device, or system within the network is treated as potentially untrustworthy until proven otherwise. By implementing continuous verification and strict access controls, Zero Trust aims to protect critical assets from both internal and external threats.
Key Components of a Zero Trust Strategy
To develop an effective Zero Trust strategy, organizations need to focus on several essential components:
- Identity and Access Management (IAM): Implementing strong authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), and utilizing identity providers to verify user identities are crucial steps in a Zero Trust environment. Additionally, adopting a least-privilege access model ensures that users have only the necessary permissions required to perform their tasks.
- Network Segmentation: Breaking the network into smaller, isolated segments helps limit the lateral movement of threats. By segmenting the network based on trust levels and applying strict access controls, organizations can contain potential breaches and minimize the scope of an attack.
- Micro-Segmentation: Extending network segmentation to the application and workload level adds an extra layer of security. By enforcing granular access controls and isolation between applications and workloads, organizations can minimize the risk of unauthorized access and limit the potential impact of an attack.
- Continuous Monitoring and Analytics: Implementing robust monitoring and analytics solutions allows organizations to gain real-time visibility into their network, detect anomalies, and respond promptly to potential security incidents. By continuously monitoring user behavior, network traffic, and system logs, organizations can identify and mitigate security threats more effectively.
- Automation and Orchestration: Embracing automation and orchestration technologies can streamline security processes, such as provisioning and deprovisioning user access, threat detection, and incident response. Automation helps ensure consistency and reduces the risk of human error, enhancing the overall security posture.
Implementation Steps for Zero Trust
While each organization’s Zero Trust implementation may vary based on its unique requirements, the following steps provide a general roadmap for creating a Zero Trust strategy:
- Assess Current Security Posture: Conduct a comprehensive assessment of existing security controls, identify vulnerabilities, and determine the scope of the Zero Trust implementation.

Introduction
In today’s digital landscape, traditional security measures are no longer sufficient to protect sensitive data and systems from evolving cyber threats. As organizations face an increasing number of sophisticated attacks, the Zero Trust concept has emerged as a proactive security approach. By adopting a Zero Trust strategy, businesses can enhance their defenses and minimize the potential impact of security breaches. In this blog post, we will explore the fundamentals of creating a Zero Trust strategy and provide actionable steps to help organizations implement this security framework effectively.
Understanding Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security framework that challenges the conventional perimeter-based approach. Instead of assuming trust based on network location, Zero Trust promotes the “never trust, always verify” concept. Every user, device, or system within the network is treated as potentially untrustworthy until proven otherwise. By implementing continuous verification and strict access controls, Zero Trust aims to protect critical assets from both internal and external threats.
Key Components of a Zero Trust Strategy
To develop an effective Zero Trust strategy, organizations need to focus on several essential components:
- Identity and Access Management (IAM): Implementing strong authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), and utilizing identity providers to verify user identities are crucial steps in a Zero Trust environment. Additionally, adopting a least-privilege access model ensures that users have only the necessary permissions required to perform their tasks.
- Network Segmentation: Breaking the network into smaller, isolated segments helps limit the lateral movement of threats. By segmenting the network based on trust levels and applying strict access controls, organizations can contain potential breaches and minimize the scope of an attack.
- Micro-Segmentation: Extending network segmentation to the application and workload level adds an extra layer of security. By enforcing granular access controls and isolation between applications and workloads, organizations can minimize the risk of unauthorized access and limit the potential impact of an attack.
- Continuous Monitoring and Analytics: Implementing robust monitoring and analytics solutions allows organizations to gain real-time visibility into their network, detect anomalies, and respond promptly to potential security incidents. By continuously monitoring user behavior, network traffic, and system logs, organizations can identify and mitigate security threats more effectively.
- Automation and Orchestration: Embracing automation and orchestration technologies can streamline security processes, such as provisioning and deprovisioning user access, threat detection, and incident response. Automation helps ensure consistency and reduces the risk of human error, enhancing the overall security posture.
Implementation Steps for Zero Trust
While each organization’s Zero Trust implementation may vary based on its unique requirements, the following steps provide a general roadmap for creating a Zero Trust strategy:
- Assess Current Security Posture: Conduct a comprehensive assessment of existing security controls, identify vulnerabilities, and determine the scope of the Zero Trust implementation.
- Define the Security Perimeter: Redefine the security perimeter to focus on individual devices, users, and data rather than a network boundary. Identify critical assets and prioritize their protection.
- Develop Access Policies: Define access policies based on the principle of least privilege, granting users only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks. Implement strong authentication methods, such as MFA, and enforce continuous user verification.
- Implement Network and Application Segmentation: Break the network into smaller, isolated segments and apply strict access controls. Extend segmentation to the application and workload level to minimize the lateral movement of threats.
- Adopt Monitoring and Analytics Tools: Deploy monitoring and analytics solutions to gain visibility into network traffic, user behavior, and system logs. Establish real-time alerting mechanisms and incident response procedures.
- Train and Educate Employees: Provide comprehensive training to employees about the Zero Trust strategy.

"Bust-Out Fraud: How it Works, How to Prevent It | Outseer",https://www.outseer.com/blog/bust-out-fraud,2022-08-17,"Bust-Out Fraud: How it Works, How to Prevent It
Bust-out fraud occurs when fraudsters build up normal credit card usage and repayment practices and then “Bust Out”, maxing out the credit line with no intention of paying back the balance.
Worried about how not to become the next victim of bust-out fraud? This article covers everything you need to know about this kind of cyber attack!
What is Bust-Out Fraud?
Bust-out fraud occurs when fraudsters build up normal credit card usage and repayment practices and then “Bust Out”, maxing out the credit line with no intention of paying back the balance. This behavior, when paired with Synthetic Identity Fraud (using a hybrid of real and fake identity information to open synthetic accounts), results in more than $6 billion in annual loss for issuers and banks, though some put the price tag as high as $20 billion.
How Does Bust-Out Fraud Work?
Bust-out fraud typically starts with the perpetrator(s) opening up credit card accounts or multiple lines of credit with different financial institutions. But it’s a growing danger for any organization that conducts business through digital channels and extends credit.
Sometimes these fraudsters use stolen identity information and strike fast before the scheme is uncovered, usually by the victim months after the fact, but increasingly, they’re using synthetic identities to do the dirty work with less risk of getting discovered before it’s too late.
Thanks to billions of personal identity files set loose through data breaches in recent years, fraudsters can easily get their fingers on everything from social security numbers to “fullz,” or complete identity information on the dark web. Especially appealing: the social security number of young children who won’t be applying for credit for years—and thus won’t raise any flags over misappropriated identity information. Studies show that 10.2% of children under age 18 have had their social security numbers swiped. In 2021, 1.25 million US children were known to be victims of identity fraud.
By combining a few pieces of legitimate personal information with phony addresses, contact information, and other data points, cyber thieves can forge numerous synthetic IDs at the same time. They’ll even set up or make use of sham businesses to establish credit for these fabricated personas through “piggybacking” on legitimate credit card accounts. Even a declined account will automatically create a credit profile—further legitimizing the identities.
Once the lines of credit are established, perpetrators will patiently nurture the accounts, demonstrating normal usage patterns and making timely payments. This establishes them as low-risk borrowers, making them more likely to be approved for additional lines of credit. Once they have built up enough lines of credit, they max out the limits and default on the loans as they vanish into thin air.
Cultivating Frankenstein-ed identities takes time, patience and attention to detail. But according to Banking Journal, individuals and crime rings can get away with between $81,000 and $97,000 per synthetic identity. No wonder the FBI calls the synthetic identity fraud that drives bust-out schemes the fastest-growing forms of financial crime today.
How Does Automation Help Bust-Out Fraudsters?
Bust-out fraudsters are always searching for opportunities to exploit, and with the ever-increasing use of automation in the financial industry, they are finding more and more ways to do so. Bots and other devices can now easily create fake IDs, making it easier for fraudsters to open multiple lines of credit simultaneously, minimizing the chances the lines will show up with each separate issuer or bank running credit checks. With painfully few exceptions, most bust-out scammers get away scot-free.
How to Detect Bust-Out Fraud
Bust-out fraud can be challenging to detect, as the perpetrators often take great care to establish themselves as low-risk borrowers before starting their schemes.
It is almost impossible to detect the fraudster from credit history or financial behavior. Many fraudsters maintain excellent credit history over multiple years before they finally bust-out, knowing full well that the average debtor who is late on making payments, even for a few months, would not typically be assumed to be a fraudster—especially lately.
Consequently, the best warnings for bust-out fraud are unusually large numbers of credit applications and invalid personal data.
Large Numbers of Credit Applications
Credit cards are the bust-out fraudsters’ favorite tools. Therefore, if the same cardholder applies for a new credit line with a credit card over and over again, this should send warning signals.
Fifteen months before the bust-out fraud, a perpetrator has two credit applications on average. Three months before the fraud, bankcard inquiries can suddenly grow to up to 10.
Mismatched Personal Data
Even with many of the identity verification systems used by some of today’s most sophisticated businesses, the task of detecting stolen or stitched-together identities can be formidable. Sure, checking public databases and cross-referencing with other data sources can spot inconsistencies that could signal fraud. Quickly and confidently confirming whether those inconsistencies evolved naturally or not is key.
Maxed Out With Minimum Payments
Put any of two or three of these factors into play, and there’s a good chance you could be staring down a bust-out in motion:
– A large number of credit applications in a short period of time
– Invalid, inconsistent, or missing personal data on applications
– Sudden increases in credit limits
– Maxing out on credit limits and making only minimum payments
– Defaulting on payments
– Lack of availability through given contact information for long periods of time
Still, for most organizations, accurately detecting any of these factors can be a tall order. When it comes to bust-out fraud, prevention is worth a pound of detection.
How to Prevent Bust-Out Fraud
Banks, credit card issuers, and other organizations looking to protect against bust-out schemes are advised to deploy solutions that recognize when synthetic identity information is being used in the account enrollment process—before credit is tapped.
Today’s most effective solutions leverage machine learning, data science, globally-shared identity and transaction data, and validation of a live human face against a government-issued ID, along with document verification against third-party databases.
Telling Friend From Faux
Bust-out fraud will only grow worse. By 2023, the synthetic identity information used in this these attacks could account for $635 billion in losses. And according to ABA Banking Journal, financial institutions operating without proper fraud prevention defenses in place miss 85% to 95% of synthetic identity-based fraud.
Thankfully, solutions exist to help detect and block bust-out fraudsters at the door—before they can cause financial carnage.

Card Not Present Fraud: Detection & Prevention | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/card-not-present-fraud,2021-09-13,"Card Not Present Fraud: Detection & Prevention
Wondering about Card Not Present (CNP) fraud? We explain what it is, why it matters, and techniques for detection and prevention.
What Is Card Not Present Fraud?
Card Not Present (CNP) fraud occurs when a bad actor makes unauthorized purchases using stolen credit card information. The potential for this form of fraud exists any time transactions are facilitated without having to present a physical card to a merchant in person.
CNP Fraud: A Growing Problem
CNP fraud has risen sharply during the ecommerce boom triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s estimated that CNP fraud will cost retailers $130 billion during the five-year between 2018 and 2023. To mitigate this threat, financial services organizations, credit card companies, and others are layering in new defenses against CNP fraud, but with varying success.
For instance, confirming CNP transactions with the customer via text message has been a growing trend, especially when the amount being transacted is unusually high. In practice, however, this can create friction that can lead impatient consumers to abandon the purchase, never to return.
As it stands now, as much as 88% of online shopping orders are abandoned. With no signs of slowing down, knowing how CNP fraud works is vital to understanding how to stop it without creating friction for legitimate transactions.
How CNP Fraud Works
CNP fraud often occurs through online phishing scams, where criminals create malicious clones of real websites that steal customer information. These phishing campaigns are usually spread via email, but they can also spread through text messages, fraudulent social media pages and rogue mobile apps.
Less commonly, dishonest employees can carry out CNP fraud, especially when taking credit card information over the phone. This can also occur at restaurants where dishonest employees hand-copy credit card information before processing your transaction.
But by far the most common way fraudsters obtain stolen credit card information is via Dark Web marketplaces where the card and other personal information is harvested from data breaches.
How to Prevent CNP Fraud
Detecting and preventing CNP fraud is crucial to card issuers and payment processors, who bear the financial burden of bad transactions. To accomplish this, these businesses can:
- Require billing address (AVS) and CVV verification to detect fraudsters who have incomplete card details
- Take down phishing sites impersonating your brand to reduce credentials harvesting
- Implement solutions that leverage the EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS) security protocol
For those unfamiliar with it, 3-D Secure (3DS) is an industry standard protocol that employs risk-based authentication to protect against fraudulent purchases while providing a frictionless shopping experience for legitimate cardholders. But not all 3DS-based solutions are created equal.
Products like Outseer 3-D Secure combine CNP fraud detection and prevention to validate each transaction and minimize your risk of chargeback losses. Unlike older methods of prevention, 3-D secure was designed to be unnoticeable to real customers, creating a secure and friendly online experience for your brand.
Businesses can prevent CNP fraud by doing the following:
- Implementing 3-D Secure protocols
- Requiring billing address (AVS) and CVV verification
- Keeping websites and online tools updated
- Leveraging firewall rules to limit exposure to risky transactions
- Taking down phishing sites before they harm your brand

"Chargeback Fraud: Is Growth in ‘Returnless Refunds’ a Gift to Consumers, Crooks Alike? | Outseer",https://www.outseer.com/blog/chargeback-fraud,2022-01-25,"Chargeback Fraud: Is Growth in ‘Returnless Refunds’ a Gift to Consumers, Crooks Alike?
Curious about chargeback fraud? Catch up on the latest concerns of refunds and what you can do to become more secure.
Amid fierce competition and rising shipping costs, a growing number of online retailers have a delightful reply to customers looking to return an item: Go ahead and keep it—on us. Can a spike in chargeback fraud be far behind?
The answer to that question is really a matter of scale. Because without the right measures in place, the hit to margins from the current wave of “returnless refunds” could be even worse than many realize.
To understand why, let’s start with the backdrop.
In a competitive ecommerce environment that has only grown more cutthroat during pandemic, returns have emerged as a key growth strategy. How well, and how frictionless merchants make the process, the more loyal their customers become.
The problem: Return rates for items purchased online have more than doubled over the last few years—reaching as high as 30% or more. Throw in shipping and another $10-$20 to process returns that in many cases can’t be resold, and you’re talking real money. As early as 2017, Amazon and others realized that in many cases, it can be cheaper to just refund customers and let them keep the items. Walmart, Target, and countless others followed suit.
According to the Wall Street Journal, the cost of returnless refunds topped $4.4 billion in 2021. But now, the economics of “returnless refunds” is about to grow a whole lot more costly.
The Rising Cost of Returnless Refunds
Last month’s holiday ecommerce bonanza? It’s giving way to as much as $120 billion in returns. United Parcel Service (UPS) alone reports it handled more than 60 million return packages from mid-November through January 22—a 10% increase from the previous year. FedEx says its return volume has set a record high.
But as the Journal reports, it will get worse in the months ahead. UPS and FedEx both say their prices will go up an average 5.9% in 2022. Those are the highest price increases in nearly a decade. And in the inflationary moment we’re living in, merchants’ own higher wages mean it’ll cost even more for them to process returns.
In short: It could become a whole lot cheaper to let customers keep a whole lot more products—a boon for legitimate shoppers, unscrupulous customers and opportunistic crooks wielding stolen credit card numbers alike.
According to a recent study, chargeback fraud already leads to $25.3 billion in annual loss. But with returnless refunds on the rise, all parties will need to become more vigilant against possible chargeback fraud—”friendly” and otherwise—without increasing friction for legitimate (but fickle) customers.
How to Secure More Revenue, Less Loss
That last part is key. At a time when cart abandonment continues to impact 75% of all purchases, credit card companies, banks, and payment processors must layer in in fraud defenses that don’t negatively impact the shopping experience.
Our own solutions, for example, combine machine learning, identity science and globally shared transaction intelligence to block CNP purchases made using stolen credit card numbers, as well as those that are likely to result in direct chargeback fraud—returnless or otherwise.
In real-world deployments, Outseer prevents 95% of all fraud loss while interrupting just 5% of all transactions. That’s the best performance in the industry. In fact, we protected more than $100 billion in payment transactions in just the first half of 2021, saving as much as $600 million in potential chargeback fraud along the way.
As it stands now, 44% of merchants report experiencing return abuse of some kind over the past 12 months, and 66% say it has been getting worse. Given conditions, returnless refunds may complicate the battle against chargeback fraud in 2022 and beyond.

Coming to America: 3-D Secure & The Fight Against CNP Fraud | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/coming-to-america-3-d-secure,2021-11-04,"Coming to America: 3-D Secure & The Fight Against CNP Fraud
3-D Secure is on the rise in North America due to the anticipated expenses of fraudulent activities. But a boost in security doesn’t have to be a loss in UX.
The EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS) protocol is de rigueur for preventing card-not-present (CNP) fraud in the EU and elsewhere. But with CNP fraud expected to top $15.3 billion this year, penetration in North America is set to explode.
So how can card issuers, banks, and merchants leverage 3DS to deliver a friction-free shopping experience without sacrificing security?
Consider where we are today. After topping $4.2 trillion this past year, post-pandemic ecommerce continues to gain momentum. Even as they return to real-world stores heading into the holiday shopping season, consumers continue to make their purchases through the web, mobile apps, text messaging, and popular payment options like Buy-Online-Pickup-in-Store (BOPIS). Nearly all of these involve a card-not-present transaction.
According to new research from Outseer and Aite-Novarica Group, total digital channel commerce will top $5.9 trillion by 2023. But while digital-channel sales have hit the stratosphere, so has CNP fraud, which is on track to exceed $17.2 billion during the same period.
With loss from this crime devouring more than 3%-5% of revenues and growing, organizations are forced to ask themselves tough questions. Do we throttle up security and risk losing revenues to false-positives and watch customers defect to competitors? Or do we prioritize customer experience (CX) and watch fraudsters make off with our profits?
But it doesn’t have to be this way. In regions around the world, the 3-D Secure protocol from EMVCo has emerged as the gold standard in stemming the rising tide of CNP fraud while actually streamlining the cardholder experience. Now, all signs point to a dramatic rise in adoption in North America—or else.
3-D Secure: Kicking Fraud (and Friction) to the Curb
At Outseer, we continue to observe rapid growth in 3DS deployment across all geographies. During the first half of 2021, the most significant increases have been seen in the UK, where 3DS transaction volumes grew to include nearly half (46%) of all CNP transactions—up from just 7% in Q3 2020. Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) have experienced similar trends.
Propelled by rising fraud rates and government or payment network mandates for multifactor authentication (MFA) in these regions, 3DS is seen as an essential deterrent to CNP fraud. The strong customer authentication (SCA) mandates in the European Union’s Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) are also driving increased adoption.
It’s easy to see why. Solutions leveraging the 3DS standard analyze hundreds of risk indicators to silently authenticate customers before a transaction even happens. In the largest global study of its kind, the Aite-Novarica Group research found that these solutions prevent more than 85% of all fraud loss while reserving step-up challenges for a very small percentage of high-risk transactions.
By itself, this should inspire accelerated 3DS adoption throughout North America. But it also presents a threat. When countries across the globe first upgraded to EMV for card-present transactions, for instance, fraud attacks migrated to those where EMV chip cards had not yet been widely deployed. The same pattern is expected to play out with 3DS. For the US and Canada, it already is.
The Great American 3DS Boom Ahead
According to the FTC, reports of credit card fraud jumped 104% in the US last year, after growing just 27% over the preceding two years combined. CNP fraud represents the vast majority of those cases—along with a 60% rise in new credit card account fraud. And it’s getting worse. We estimate US CNP fraud loss will total $7.9 billion by the end of 2021—nearly half the $15.3 billion in total CNP loss expected worldwide this year.
To be clear, 3DS adoption in the Americas has been growing at a rapid clip, just not as fast as in the EU. During the second quarter of 2021, a full 37% of all CNP transactions in the Americas were protected by 3DS, up from just 10% in Q3 2020. Yet while admirable, it’s still 10% lower than the UK and EU. And that makes US-based CNP transactions and account openings more tempting prey for fraudsters out to weaponize an endless amount of stolen identity and credit card information. Especially if the gap widens further.
But there are also a number of other reasons 3DS is about to catch fire in the US and Canada.
- Merchants and issuers doing business in the EU’s $300 billion e-commerce market are exempt from PSD2’s SCA requirements for now—but that could change on a dime
- Regulatory fervor is spreading fast: Mexico, Australia and others have also started to adopt SCA regimes
- Even if federal regulators are slow to take action, it’s just a matter of time until California or other states enact such standards, too (spoiler alert: Don’t be surprised if Kansas beats the Golden State to the punch after seeing identity fraud-related complaints spike 1,801% since 2019)
Stopping Fraud, Not Transactions
Needless to say, 3DS adoption is also just smart business. According to Visa Research, up to 72% of online shoppers have abandoned a shopping card over security concerns. But 3-D Secure has been shown to reduce checkout times by 85% and cart abandonment by 70%. In addition to increased revenue, fewer false positives and less intervention make for better transaction experiences—and happier, more loyal customers.
Best of all, North American issuers, merchants and others can leverage fully-hosted solutions that prevent up to 95% of fraudulent CNP transactions with only 5% requiring challenges. All without the need for additional IT staffing or overhead. Given the risks and rewards, 3-D Secure deployment should be job #1 starting now.

Consumer Scams: The Right Way to Train Your Staff | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/consumer-scams-the-right-way-to-train-your-staff,2025-09-15,"Consumer Scams: The Right Way to Train Your Staff
Bank staff are the critical last line of defense against sophisticated transnational scams, using psychology and tailored training to intervene and prevent victims’ losses.
There is much discussion around the severe threat of consumer Scams. This is transnational organized crime, driven by massive scam compounds in southeast Asia. Victims are psychologically groomed to transfer millions of dollars. Banks, telcos and digital platforms all must implement controls to help prevent these Scams from occurring.
Detecting the Scam Is Only the Start of the Battle
The Scam controls have already been covered in the whitepaper I wrote—and what gets less attention is what happens after detection. For example, Banks might alert on a suspicious transaction such as:
- an elderly customer doing their first wire and it is $50,000
- or a customer walks into a branch to withdraw $20,000
The spotlight is now turned on the Bank employee who talk with the customer and they must:
- understand what this transaction is about
- understand if it is a Scam
- and finally, to convince the customer to cancel the transaction if it appears to be one
This final step is the moment when all of the Scam controls will bear fruit or collapse.
The Psychology of Why People Believe in the Scammers
In August I had a chance to talk with two Canadian psychologists who specialize in Scam Prevention. Kelly Peters (Behavioural Economics Leader and Partner) and Michelle Hilscher, PhD (Senior Manager, Behavioural Economics) work in Deloitte’s Behavioral Economics Group in Toronto, and many thanks to the Canadian Bankers Association for the introduction.
Kelly and Michelle talked about how to train bank staff for when they interact with customers who appear to be Scam Victims. The goal is to prevent the Scam monies from leaving the bank and saving the customer from loss.
Kelly reminded me that people know the right thing to do. But life injects itself at times with emotion, pain, grief, pressure, loneliness and shame, among other 'runaway train’ events. It is during these events that Scammers will be most successful as the customer is vulnerable
When I asked how bank staff should respond to a Scam alert, Kelly said:
- “do the what the fraudsters are doing”
- “the fraudsters have mastered the psychology of grooming victims”
- “banks need to use that same psychology to help break the spell”
- “banks need to convince the customer they are being Scammed”
- “The bank staff need to meet and beat the Scammers”
She pointed out Scammers effectively exploit psychological factors that Bank staff often overlook when dealing with clients.
The SAFETY Framework
Kelly defined the framework used by Scammers as the SAFETY Framework.
- Social: people are vulnerable because they want social connection and belonging.
- Attractiveness of the offer: the Scammer is offering something exciting and immediate.
- Feelings and emotions: people may be vulnerable because of their emotions and once a Scam involved, get trapped by their emotions.
- Errors (and biases): misestimated probability—people like to use shortcuts to keep their lives simple, but this means they can make mistakes that leave the vulnerable to being Scammed.
- Time (act now!): people act fast under pressure, or act before thinking.
- Yielding Self-Control and Risk-Taking: people sometimes seek out risk and throw caution to the wind, making them vulnerable.
How Can Bank Staff Break the Spell of the Scammers
Michelle then gave specifics on how Bank staff should interact with a customer in the branch or on the phone. If they spot a suspicious transaction (wire, cash withdrawal) she advised:
- Step in as an authority figure.
- be someone the customer can feel comfortable working with.
- You are attempting to offset the Scammer acting as an authority figure.
- This is appropriate on short-cons, where they ‘represent’ the local sheriff or taxing authority.
- Move the discussion to a perspective view.
- Try to put the customer into the ‘shoes of another person.’
- Ask the customer to think if this happened to one of their friends, how would they think about it?
- Make the customer feel comfortable to pause.
- Normalize the experience.
- Remove the feeling of shame.
- Reduce the pressure of this moment.
- Explain these types of events happen to good and smart people.
- It can be appropriate to bring up the liability issue (if you send this money and there is a Scam, it will be solely your loss).
- Do NOT bring this point up at the end of the conversation.
- Bring it up at the beginning of the conversation.
- Make it clear you want to help them decide on this issue.
- You want to give them the feeling you are with them, not against them.
- Scammers will warn the victim about the Bank trying to stop them.
- If you bring this liability issue up at the end, you will potentially damage the relationship built up with the victim.
Is Focusing on Customer Liability a Workable Option?
Kelly was asked about giving the customer a Withdrawal Alert Warning Form to sign. The form would include samples of Scam scenarios and warning the customer is fully liable for the loss, with a space for the customer signature.
She said this could have unintended consequences.
- It could make the customer more entrenched to complete the withdrawal.
- It could distance the customer from the bank.
She suggested a better way to address this would be to give the customer an interactive prompt instead:
- An iPad (or go to a branch PC) could present an interactive screen.
- With the help of AI it will go through Scam scenarios.
- Let the customer complete the ‘self-assessment.’
- Real-time prompts appear based on the answers.
- This can help to restore a balance of power between the Bank staff and the customer.
Is there a Best Way to Train Bank Staff?
Kelly and Michelle said that proper staff training is important for staff morale. When staff have these interactions, they feel defeat when they cannot retain the money in the bank and the customer remains a victim. Better training will get a better success rate – the transaction cancelled and customer saved. So, better training is as much for the benefit of the staff themselves as well as the customer.
They emphasized that finding the best approach for each customer interactions will take trial and error, just like how the Scammer worked to master the best grooming pitch. Try, fail, try again in training, not when dealing with real customers
Michelle focused on measuring the success of the training using role playing:
- How many interactions took place?
- How many times was the money saved?
- And how much was saved?
- What type of Scam was it? (Scam type and short vs long con)
- How long are the interactions? (shorter is better if with recovery)
Key Points Any Interaction With a Scam Victim Needs To Consider
In closing I asked Michelle and Kelly what are a few quick pointers for Bank staff, ahead of any training. She said:
- Have empathy for the customer.
- Don’t give up when your gut says it is fishy!
- Remember at the moment of the interdiction, the customer is an agent of the Scammer.
Kelly said it is important for banks to realize that:
- “consumer Scams will get exponentially worse with AI”
- ""all channels to effectively deal with customers when there is a Scam alert”
- “help consumers identify these Scams early on”
Final Thoughts
I really enjoyed interviewing Kelly Peters and Michelle Hilscher—it reinforced for me that staff training should be the number one Scam control for banks. But to be successful it really needs to be covering the psychology of:
- the Scam
- the customer interdiction
I know many Banks (and of course credit unions and fintechs) are paying much more attention on fighting consumer Scams. I hope this brief article helps frame the importance of effective staff training to help keep the funds for the customer. Bank staff are the first responders for consumer Scams. Make them count!

Consumer Scams: The Right Way to Train Your Staff
Bank staff are the critical last line of defense against sophisticated transnational scams, using psychology and tailored training to intervene and prevent victims’ losses.
There is much discussion around the severe threat of consumer Scams. This is transnational organized crime, driven by massive scam compounds in southeast Asia. Victims are psychologically groomed to transfer millions of dollars. Banks, telcos and digital platforms all must implement controls to help prevent these Scams from occurring.
Detecting the Scam Is Only the Start of the Battle
The Scam controls have already been covered in the whitepaper I wrote—and what gets less attention is what happens after detection. For example, Banks might alert on a suspicious transaction such as:
- an elderly customer doing their first wire and it is $50,000
- or a customer walks into a branch to withdraw $20,000
The spotlight is now turned on the Bank employee who talk with the customer and they must:
- understand what this transaction is about
- understand if it is a Scam
- and finally, to convince the customer to cancel the transaction if it appears to be one
This final step is the moment when all of the Scam controls will bear fruit or collapse.
The Psychology of Why People Believe in the Scammers
In August I had a chance to talk with two Canadian psychologists who specialize in Scam Prevention. Kelly Peters (Behavioural Economics Leader and Partner) and Michelle Hilscher, PhD (Senior Manager, Behavioural Economics) work in Deloitte’s Behavioral Economics Group in Toronto, and many thanks to the Canadian Bankers Association for the introduction.
Kelly and Michelle talked about how to train bank staff for when they interact with customers who appear to be Scam Victims. The goal is to prevent the Scam monies from leaving the bank and saving the customer from loss.
Kelly reminded me that people know the right thing to do. But life injects itself at times with emotion, pain, grief, pressure, loneliness and shame, among other 'runaway train’ events. It is during these events that Scammers will be most successful as the customer is vulnerable
When I asked how bank staff should respond to a Scam alert, Kelly said:
- “do the what the fraudsters are doing”
- “the fraudsters have mastered the psychology of grooming victims”
- “banks need to use that same psychology to help break the spell”
- “banks need to convince the customer they are being Scammed”
- “The bank staff need to meet and beat the Scammers”
She pointed out Scammers effectively exploit psychological factors that Bank staff often overlook when dealing with clients.
The SAFETY Framework
Kelly defined the framework used by Scammers as the SAFETY Framework.
- Social: people are vulnerable because they want social connection and belonging.
- Attractiveness of the offer: the Scammer is offering something exciting and immediate.
- Feelings and emotions: people may be vulnerable because of their emotions and once a Scam involved, get trapped by their emotions.
- Errors (and biases): misestimated probability—people like to use shortcuts to keep their lives simple, but this means they can make mistakes that leave the vulnerable to being Scammed.
- Time (act now!): people act fast under pressure, or act before thinking.
- Yielding Self-Control and Risk-Taking: people sometimes seek out risk and throw caution to the wind, making them vulnerable.

How Did You Get Your Covid Pass? | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/covid-pass,2021-12-17,"How Did You Get Your Covid Pass?
New Study Details Phishing Attacks Exploiting the Green Pass Economy
Is it a case of making strides—or one-step-forward, two-steps-back?
After long and difficult distancing and lockdown mandates, nations around the world are gradually returning to something approaching normalcy. With each new day, businesses are slowly reopening and economies are getting back on track. With acknowledgement that the pandemic is here to stay, many countries have begun implementing measures to protect the progress made so far, while mitigating the threat posed by each new COVID variant that emerges.
On that score, some have begun issuing “Green Passes” to quickly differentiate between people who have been vaccinated or have recovered from COVID, and those who have not. An array of official and informal sanctions are also being imposed across public and private sectors. That includes everything from compulsory vaccinations with fines of thousands of dollars for non-compliance, to workplaces that require employees to provide proof of vaccination or face suspension, to pubs and nightclubs that ban the un-vaxxed from vibing and imbibing with their crew.
Progress, to be sure. But a new study from our FraudAction team finds fraud groups are actively seeking to capitalize on this tentative new phase of life under COVID—and what you don’t know can cost you plenty.
Green Passes: A Greenlight for Fraud?
As hard as it is to believe, misinformation surrounding vaccine safety still flows freely thanks to social media, disreputable news outlets, and divisive public figures. Even the most outlandish conspiracy theories continue to circulate, including those claiming governments use the vaccine to implant tracking chips, or that vaccines cause everything from infertility to autism to unintended magnetism. Is it any wonder a sizable minority of the population refuses to get vaccinated?
As with each new juncture in the COVID timeline, fraudsters are keen to exploit new and existing uncertainties—and new Green Pass regimes offer a powerful new vein to mine. Ever the opportunists, fraudsters are seeking to exploit this new period of heightened anxiety and social polarization in order to offer what appear to be solutions.
Among the most egregious: fake green passes designed to grant the freedoms afforded by legitimate COVID passes without actually getting vaccinated.
Not Just Phishing for an Easy Way Out
The wary, gullible, and just plain obstinate aren’t the only discreet factions being targeted in these scams. Even those who are fully vaccinated and seeking legitimate COVID passes are falling prey.
In some ploys, fraudsters set up expertly-crafted phishing pages resembling official government agency websites in order to fool people into entering personal data as part of the Green Pass registration process. This includes full name, ID number, SSN, date of birth, financial payment information, and other sensitive details presented as required identity proof before COVID passes can be issued.
For those who fall victim, the results could prove devastating.
Deception’s Dangerous Side Effects
Thanks to these and other Green Pass schemes, people purchasing COVID passes legitimate or otherwise are at risk of having their personal data stolen and quickly monetized.
This data can be sold in darkweb marketplaces. In one of these venues, a fraudster is claiming to hold the personal data of 500,000 Russian citizens bamboozled into buying fake COVID certificates.
Pilfered personal data can also be used to drain victims’ bank accounts, apply for loans, file unemployment claims, and more.
In a case of adding insult to outrageous injury, some fraudsters use phishing attacks to harvest personal data, post it to darknet marketplaces, and then extort the victims through offers to have it removed for a fee before other criminals purchase it.
Honor Among Thieves? Or Just Self-Preservation?
Most cybercriminals show no compunction about capitalizing on people’s fear or anger over vaccinations. But this isn’t a universal point of view. Outseer’s FraudAction researchers have observed threads in venues used by cybercriminals in which fraudsters question whether selling COVID certificates should even be allowed. As one swindler’s view, such scams are “immoral and puts millions in danger.”
Then again, the sentiment doesn’t necessarily reflect a code of honor or some otherwise undetectable form of altruism. Given COVID’s transmissibility, the millions put in danger by these crimes could easily include themselves and their loved ones.
The Cure for Green Pass Fraud
Businesses, public sector agencies, and other organizations seeking protection against phishing attacks hawking fraudulent Green Passes or the ability to detect counterfeit passes, should source an all-inclusive cyber-intelligence provider.
Using our own offering as an example, Outseer FraudAction provides comprehensive, 24/7 cyber-intelligence and takedown services. The experts in our Anti-Fraud Command Center continuously monitor the threat landscape to detect and shut down phishing sites, phony mobile apps, and fraudulent social media pages used to impersonate your organization—before they do serious harm to your operations, employees, customers, or constituents.
This includes organizations that issue Green Passes at risk of impersonation, as well as businesses with processes for demonstrating compliance with Green Pass or COVID testing mandates. Our threat intelligence feeds alert you to new counterfeit passes and testing results—as well as any other cyber-threat to your organization.

Interested in cryptocurrency? Watch out for this rising trend in crypto scams.
INTRODUCTION
Thanks in part to the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, cryptocurrencies have gained renewed attention that has led to a significant spike in trading volume.
In 2014, when Bitcoin was trading at roughly $500, venture capitalist Tim Draper predicted it would reach a valuation of $10,000 within three years. By December 2017, Bitcoin had in fact reached an all-time high of almost $20,000.
In April 2018, Draper went on to predict that Bitcoin will top $250,000 by the end of 2022/early 2023, although it was valued only at $8,000 at the time.
It seems the pandemic is bringing this once inapprehensible forecast closer to reality. When the pandemic erupted, Bitcoin could be purchased for around $7,300. Today, the very same Bitcoin costs roughly $60,000—a rise of about 700%. Other cryptocurrencies created just since the start of the pandemic are up millions of percent. Shiba Inu, for instance, was created in August 2020 and has already seen its value skyrocket more than 70 million percent. (Shiba Inu was listed in exchanges during 2021.) Ethereum and other prominent cryptocurrencies showed similar increases.
With thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation, and new altcoins emerging every week, cybercriminals have developed several schemes to defraud those looking to profit from the phenomenon. By August 2021, cybercriminals stole nearly $3 billion in cryptocurrencies. We will review some of these incredibly profitable scams in this report.
Bitcoin (BTC)
The original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin was created in 2009 by a person who uses the alias “Satoshi Nakomoto”. The maximum number of bitcoins that will ever be in existence is 21 million, and over the years, many bitcoins have been lost and buried in inaccessible hard drives. Bitcoin leverages a global network of computers that maintain a shared ledger called a blockchain that keeps track of who owns Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s market capitalization is the largest among all cryptocurrencies, presently valued at reaching $1.13 trillion.
Ethereum (ETH)
Ethereum was created in 2014, and unlike Bitcoin, has no cap of maximum tokens—meaning more tokens can be created according to demand. The most basic function of programs built on the Ethereum platform is to facilitate smart contracts. The token Ether functions like a digital commodity—you need Ether to run applications on the Ethereum blockchain. Ether is the world’s second-largest virtual currency by market capitalization.
Monero (XMR)
Monero was launched in 2014, and its focus is anonymity. The details of a transaction within the Monero ledger are hidden; the sender is obfuscated, the address of the recipient is hidden using stealth addresses, and there is no way to know the amount of the transaction. Monero is the 41st largest virtual currency in terms of market capitalization. This is a popular cryptocurrency mined by crypto jacking malware.
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
Shiba Inu is an Ethereum-based altcoin that was created in August 2020 by the anonymous “Ryoshi.” Its tokens are the currency of the decentralized exchange ShibaSwap, which lets users trade between Shiba Inu and other crypto tokens. It is the 11th largest virtual currency.
THE MODERN GOLD RUSH
The frenzy surrounding Bitcoin is reminiscent of the gold rush of 1849, when more than 380,000 fortune seekers made their way to California. While modern cryptocurrency investors can earn riches from the comfort of their couches, the two markets bear numerous similarities. The cryptocurrency market cap has recently hit $3 trillion, which is almost a third of gold’s market cap of $11.6 trillion, some predict that it’s only a matter of time until the market cap of cryptocurrencies reaches that of gold.
Another similarity: the frenzy surrounding them, which in both cases had led to all sorts of scams. In the mid-1800s people tried to sell fake (“fool’s”) gold or steal the hard-earned gold of miners. In the 21st century, the cryptocurrency landscape is plagued by comparable dangers, with new schemes emerging by the day.
A recent example is the Squid Game crypto ($SQUID) token created in the wake of hype surrounding the hit Netflix show. It emerged in late October and reached a peak of $2,861, before crashing to near $0. Investors have poured into the token $3.38m, only for it to collapse in an apparent scam.
This scam has become known as a “rug pull”; it occurs when people start investing in a new coin that looks legitimate and receives wide coverage by respected media outlets and social media influencers. Once the coin gains traction, its creators quickly sell their holdings and make off with the money—leaving investors with empty pockets.

CRYPTOJACKING
Cryptojacking occurs when attackers secretly use one’s computer resources to mine cryptocurrencies.
Figure 2: Fraudster shares article describing how to covertly mine cryptocurrencies in Russian Forum
Figure 3: Fraudster sells crypto miner for €60 in leak Forum
Popular since 2017 until it was shut down in 2019, internet browsers, browser extensions, and mobile apps were used to spread “Coinhive”—a Javascript miner for Monero that steals the processing power of users’ devices.
Another example of a malicious cryptocurrency miner is “Crackonosh”, which is hidden in popular cracked games, including pirated versions of the games GTA V and NBA 2K19. The main target of Crackonosh is to install XMRig, a popular and well-known Monero coinminer, on victims’ devices. The malware in question seems to be of Czech origin, and so far, it appears that hackers have made over $2 million by infecting devices.
LemonDuck is another form of Monero crypto-mining malware. It can start with infecting a single computer and spread across an entire organization’s network, turning its entire computer resources into mining slaves. Cryptocurrency campaigns of LemonDuck first surfaced in May 2019.
Outseer FraudAction researchers have analyzed hundreds of samples related to cryptocurrency mining over the past three months, and were able to split the samples into three types:
Almost 60% of samples were malware designed specifically to perform mining, also known as Cryptominers. Notable examples include LemonDuck, Acrux and XMRig. Approximately 20% of the malware samples were malware known as “stealers” which are used to steal crypto wallets but have evolved to possess mining abilities, such as Racoon and L0rdix. The remaining samples were downloaders of miners. Downloaders are used to open the door to additional types of malware, in this case, to allow the ability to mine cryptocurrencies.
5 WAYS TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM CRYPTO-FRAUDSTERS
Despite frequent swings, the promise of high valuations for cryptocurrencies and expected growth in adoption mean the fraud surrounding them will continue to grow and evolve. Even if you feel like you have seen it all and think this as just another type of online fraud, the reality is that cryptocurrency scams can fool even the savviest among us.
But you can lower your chances of falling victim by following a few basic measures. First and most important, as with any credentials you possess, it’s critically important to keep them to yourself—don’t share them with anyone. Using a reputable ad blocker will help prevent the exploitation of your machines for mining.
Another measure worth the effort: blacklisting domains used by crypto-miners and botnets. Refrain from downloading pirated content that might infect your machine. Additionally, monitor code repositories and paste sites to better protect your organization. Just because a recommendation came from a celebrity or social media influencer, that doesn’t mean it’s a good investment—in some cases, the person may be paid to publish the endorsement.
Those looking to protect organizations from the malware unleashed in these scams should also consider sourcing an all-inclusive cyber-intelligence service. Using our own offering as an example, Outseer FraudAction provides comprehensive, 24/7 protection against Trojans and other malware, as well as expert threat intelligence feeds to help you stay on top of emerging threats to your organization.
While cryptocurrencies may offer plenty of promise, they come with plenty of peril to go around.

INTRODUCTION
Thanks in part to the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, cryptocurrencies have gained renewed attention that has led to a significant spike in trading volume.
In 2014, when Bitcoin was trading at roughly $500, venture capitalist Tim Draper predicted it would reach a valuation of $10,000 within three years. By December 2017, Bitcoin had in fact reached an all-time high of almost $20,000.
In April 2018, Draper went on to predict that Bitcoin will top $250,000 by the end of 2022/early 2023, although it was valued only at $8,000 at the time.
It seems the pandemic is bringing this once inapprehensible forecast closer to reality. When the pandemic erupted, Bitcoin could be purchased for around $7,300. Today, the very same Bitcoin costs roughly $60,000—a rise of about 700%. Other cryptocurrencies created just since the start of the pandemic are up millions of percent. Shiba Inu, for instance, was created in August 2020 and has already seen its value skyrocket more than 70 million percent. (Shiba Inu was listed in exchanges during 2021.) Ethereum and other prominent cryptocurrencies showed similar increases.
With thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation, and new altcoins emerging every week, cybercriminals have developed several schemes to defraud those looking to profit from the phenomenon. By August 2021, cybercriminals stole nearly $3 billion in cryptocurrencies. We will review some of these incredibly profitable scams in this report.
Bitcoin (BTC)
The original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin was created in 2009 by a person who uses the alias “Satoshi Nakomoto”. The maximum number of bitcoins that will ever be in existence is 21 million, and over the years, many bitcoins have been lost and buried in inaccessible hard drives. Bitcoin leverages a global network of computers that maintain a shared ledger called a blockchain that keeps track of who owns Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s market capitalization is the largest among all cryptocurrencies, presently valued at reaching $1.13 trillion.
Ethereum (ETH)
Ethereum was created in 2014, and unlike Bitcoin, has no cap of maximum tokens—meaning more tokens can be created according to demand. The most basic function of programs built on the Ethereum platform is to facilitate smart contracts. The token Ether functions like a digital commodity—you need Ether to run applications on the Ethereum blockchain. Ether is the world’s second-largest virtual currency by market capitalization.
Monero (XMR)
Monero was launched in 2014, and its focus is anonymity. The details of a transaction within the Monero ledger are hidden; the sender is obfuscated, the address of the recipient is hidden using stealth addresses, and there is no way to know the amount of the transaction. Monero is the 41st largest virtual currency in terms of market capitalization. This is a popular cryptocurrency mined by crypto jacking malware.
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
Shiba Inu is an Ethereum-based altcoin that was created in August 2020 by the anonymous “Ryoshi.” Its tokens are the currency of the decentralized exchange ShibaSwap, which lets users trade between Shiba Inu and other crypto tokens. It is the 11th largest virtual currency.

Wondering about cryptocurrency fraud? We explain what cryptocurrency fraud is, explore the most common scams and schemes, and discuss the best strategies for prevention.
What Is Cryptocurrency Fraud?
Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that exists electronically. Cryptocurrency fraud is becoming more common and exists in many forms:
- Scam offerings
- Ponzi Schemes
- Traditional Theft
- Pump and Dump schemes
Spotting cryptocurrency fraud can be tough, especially in the fast-paced world of decentralized finance. While there are many opportunities and promising projects, the cryptocurrency world is largely unregulated, making it a hotbed for cybercriminals.
Before we explore how cryptocurrency fraud works, let’s cover the basics of how most cryptocurrencies work.
Cryptocurrency Basics
Understanding the very basics of how crypto works is half the battle to securing your cryptocurrency. Many scams exploit beginners who don’t have a solid understanding of how their wallet works, what private keys do, and who actually has control over their cryptocurrency.
In traditional banking, we have secure physical places where our money is stored, like the bank or a safety deposit box. With cryptocurrency, the person who controls the private key can move and spend the currency digitally.
If your private key is lost or stolen, access to your cryptocurrency could be lost forever. You can think of this private key as your unique signature that is required any time you want to move or spend your cryptocurrency.
Each wallet has its own unique private key that can be used to transfer coins. Not all wallets are created equal, especially from a security perspective.
Hot Wallets
Hot wallets are wallets that are connected to the internet. They are convenient for trading, swapping, and spending, but have a higher chance of being compromised by cybercriminals due to their connectivity and online access. Browser-based wallets such as MetaMask are great for holding small amounts of currency but aren’t an ideal place to store large sums of cryptocurrency.
Cold Wallets
Cold wallets exist offline and are a better option for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency for the long term. Cold wallets aren’t ideal for those looking to spend their coins frequently or trade throughout the day since it takes longer to perform a transaction. Those looking for a cold wallet can purchase a hardware wallet like the Ledger, or even create a paper wallet for free.
Exchanges
There’s a saying in the cryptocurrency community, “not your keys, not your coins.” When users keep their cryptocurrency on an exchange, they don’t own the rights to control that currency. This means if the exchange is hacked or decides to scam its users, any cryptocurrency stored on that exchange can be stolen.
Keeping large amounts of cryptocurrency on an exchange is incredibly risky. Users should consider moving significant amounts of coins off the exchange as soon as possible. Exchanges are massive targets for cybercriminals due to the amount of wealth they hold. Billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency have been stolen from exchanges through phishing scams, brute-force attacks, and outright fraud.
With the basics out of the way, let’s look into some particular instances of cryptocurrency fraud, and explore ways to prevent it.
Examples of Cryptocurrency Fraud
Scam Initial Coin Offerings
Similar to an Initial Public Offering (IPO), cryptocurrency projects have ICOs during launch. ICOs are exciting because getting in on a big project early could lead to incredible returns. Unfortunately, scammers can spin up a fake ICO with very little money or effort.
Many scam ICOs promise massive returns and take advantage of current trends. For example, SQUID coin was a scam ICO that leveraged the popularity of the Netflix series Squid Game to gain exposure.
The creators of a scam ICO hold a majority of the coins in their wallets and watch as more people exchange dollars for their coins. On paper, scam ICOs can look incredibly profitable with massive “theoretical” returns. Oftentimes there is very little liquidity in the market, meaning even if a coin holder is up 1000%, they can’t exit their position.
Owners of a scam ICO sell their lion’s share of coins as the scam continues to gain traction or simply sell off all their coins at once and disappear. This is called a “rug pull” or getting “rugged.”
You can avoid Scam ICOs by doing the following:
- Research the team and review their whitepaper
- Checking the blockchain to make sure no single wallets hold a majority of the currency
- Use community tools that audit new coins and track scams
Pump and Dump
Pump and dump scams are similar to scam ICOs but can happen multiple times with the same cryptocurrency. Majority owners of a particular currency will attempt to hype up a coin and artificially drive the price up. False claims, photoshopped images, and fake testimonials can all lead to a sharp rise in price as investors try to get in early. As the price reaches its artificial peak, the scammers dump their coins all at once, causing the market to crash.
You can avoid pump and dump scams by doing the following:
- Researching claims extensively before buying
- Using open forums like Reddit to get different opinions
- Avoiding projects with too-good-to-be-true promises
Ponzi Schemes
Ponzi Schemes rely on a steady stream of new investors in order to pay artificial returns to early adopters. One of the most infamous Ponzi schemes in the world of cryptocurrency was Bitconnect, which marketed itself as a high-yield investment program.
Bitconnect ultimately collapsed after reaching a near $500 high. Founders of Bitconnect made off with close to $2 billion before the price plummeted to under one dollar. While many called out Bitconnect as a scam before its collapse, not all Ponzi schemes are as obvious.
Here’s how you can avoid cryptocurrency Ponzi schemes:
- Avoid projects that use multi-level marketing tactics
- Be suspicious of promises and wildly large returns
- Avoid projects you don’t fully understand
Theft
There are also organized crime rings that target large wallets and exchanges. Cybercriminals often use phishing campaigns to gain access to secure networks and computers. Phishing works by tricking users into clicking a link and entering their information into a malicious clone of a legitimate site. Cybercriminals can steal credentials and private keys using this method.
In some cases, keyloggers, spyware, and trojans are used to silently monitor networks for signs of cryptocurrency wallets or access to exchanges. When the user accesses their wallet, the private key is stolen and their funds are moved to the scammer’s wallet.
You can avoid cryptocurrency theft by doing the following:
- Installing antivirus software
- Never sharing your private key
- Keeping large amounts of cryptocurrency in cold wallets (offline)
How Can Crypto Exchanges Prevent Cryptocurrency Fraud
Exchanges are arguably one of the biggest targets for cryptocurrency fraud, as a single compromised system can scam thousands of users at once. Not only do exchanges need to invest in network security, but they also must protect their brand from impersonation.
As traditional brute-force attacks become more difficult, scammers are now doubling down on brand impersonation, phishing attacks, and rogue mobile apps to steal information and funds from unsuspecting users.
Exchanges and official project pages are continuously at risk of being impersonated on social media, email, and domain registration. Even just a few successful brand impersonation attacks can impact the trust between the customer and the brand.
Manually reporting fake accounts, sending takedown requests, and policing messages is a nearly impossible task. Thankfully, exchanges now leverage advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning to not only detect fraud but completely shut it down before it reaches customers.

The Dangers of Credential Stuffing and How to Prevent It | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/dangers-of-credential-stuffing-how-to-prevent-it,2022-06-29,"The Dangers of Credential Stuffing and How to Prevent It
Credential stuffing is when a bot, script, or other automation exploits a series of stolen login credentials (usernames and passwords) to infiltrate user accounts. Read on to learn how to protect your organization from this fraudulent action.
What Is Credential Stuffing?
Credential stuffing is an automated account takeover (ATO) attack in which compromised usernames and passwords are leveraged to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
Credential stuffing is typically perpetrated with automated tools like bots or scripts that attempt to gain access to accounts by testing multiple credential combinations until they find a match. Thanks to a rising number of phishing scams and an endless stream of data breaches, fraudsters can purchase large volumes of credentials through dark web marketplaces.
Once they’ve gained access to an account, these cybercriminals are free to make unauthorized purchases using stolen or card-on-file payment details, transfer money out of checking and savings accounts, or pilfer sensitive corporate or personal data.
This can also be a stepping stone to hijacking the user’s other accounts or systems. It doesn’t help that many of us tend to use easily deduced variations of the same 10 passwords for banking, retail, utilities, social media, workplace applications, and everything in between.
The losses from successful ATOs in 2021 is estimated at over $12 billion. But destroyed reputations and lost customer trust can cost billions more. Credentials stuffing enables cybercriminal organizations to automate this crime at scale.
“In 2020, there were 193 billion credential stuffing attacks globally, with 3.4 billion hitting financial services organization specifically.”
Credential Stuffing: A Closer Look
Here’s how credential stuffing works:
Step 1: Cybercriminal organizations harvest or acquire mass lists of stolen usernames and passwords. These lists are sold on the dark web or traded in underground forums.
Step 2: The stolen credentials are added to a botnet, a network of infected computers that the hacker can control remotely. The botnet automates the process of trying different username and password combinations at high velocities. Due to rampant password re-use, credentials stuffing attacks simultaneously test these login combinations across dozens or even hundreds of different sites.
Step 3: If a login is successful on any one of these sites, the fraudster gains access to that account. And if the login credentials are the same for other accounts belonging to the user, they could quickly fall into the hands of the attackers.
Step 4: The attacker is also free to use the account to commit various types of fraud, such as buying items with a stolen credit card, applying for loans, selling counterfeit goods, draining banking accounts, and more.
Financial services and online merchants in particular have found themselves under continuous attack from the kind of compromised accounts credential stuffing affords fraudsters. During the third quarter of 2021, for instance, Outseer saw that 71.9% of e-commerce fraud and 76.5% of digital banking fraud was committed through trusted user accounts accessed on a new device.

Credential Stuffing vs. Brute Force Attacks
Credential stuffing is often confused with brute force attacks. However, there are key differences between the two.
In the brute force attack, a fraudster tries to guess passwords or PINs by trying every possible combination until they find the correct one. Brute force attacks can be very time-consuming and often require a lot of computing power.
Credential stuffing, on the other hand, is far more efficient. This is because credential stuffing attackers use lists of stolen usernames and passwords that are readily available on the dark web. All the attacker has to do is to upload stolen credentials to a botnet, and the botnet will do the rest.
Another key difference is that brute force attacks attempt to try multiple username and password combinations against one or a handful of accounts, while credential stuffing attacks target known user login combinations against numerous websites.
Protection From Credential Stuffing for Individuals
Protection from credential stuffing is much easier for individuals than it is for organizations.
One of the most effective protection tactics for individuals is using different passwords for different accounts and changing them often. Using a password manager can help track all the different passwords without hassle. This may seem like a lot of work, but having all of your accounts secured is definitely worth it.
Another tactic individuals can use is enable two-factor authentication (2FA). This means that in addition to the account password, a user must input a one-time code sent to his device. 2FA makes it much harder (though not impossible) for attackers to access an account, even if they have the password.
Individuals should also be careful about the personal information they share online. Attackers often analyze their targets’ personal information on social media to guess their passwords or answer security questions.
Finally, being suspicious of any email or text message asking you to click through to a website to input a password or other sensitive information is a must. These are often phishing scams and can expose accounts to hackers.
Protection From Credential Stuffing for Organizations
Introducing protective measures against these attacks can be tricky for card issuers, banks, payment processors, or merchants. Striking the right balance between security and customer experience can be as difficult as it is critical—especially at a time when legitimate users may bail after just 30 seconds of added friction.
The most effective course of action is to employ detection and prevention tools that can differentiate between legitimate users and credential stuffing attacks. Outseer’s own account monitoring solution, for instance, defeats both fraudulent access and user friction at the same time.
Through identity science, predictive analytics, and strong authentication options such as FIDO compliant biometrics and passwordless authentication methods, we seamlessly distinguish between authentic users and intruders.
Unlike CAPTCHA checks, our frictionless fraud detection provides a fast, friendly user experience while kicking credential stuffing and other fraud attacks to the curb. By preventing 95% of all fraud loss with intervention rates as low as 5%, we deliver the best protection in the industry.
Stopping Credential Stuffing But Not Legitimate Users
Effective protection against credential stuffing is possible when combining advanced security solutions along with employee awareness. Organizations should make sure employees understand the risks of credential stuffing attacks and are trained to spot phishing scams and other social engineering-based attacks that could expose their login credentials.
Deploying the right tools and training can be a big win for everybody but the bad guys.

Decoding Phishing: A Deep Dive into Modern Scam Tactics | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/decoding-phishing-a-deep-dive-into-modern-scam-tactics,2023-08-10,"Decoding Phishing: A Deep Dive into Modern Scam Tactics
Having spent countless hours studying cybersecurity and researching digital fraud threats, I find it extremely important to share my insights and learnings on these matters. In our recent webinar, From Scam to Cashout: Follow the Money Trail, we delved deep into the multifaceted realm of scams and phishing in particular, and I wanted to share some of my key takeaways with you.
Beyond Emails: The Multifaceted World of Phishing
Many associate phishing primarily with deceptive emails, but our digital interactions and phishing methods have evolved. In our session, I emphasized the rise of SMS messages, deceptive online ads, social media, and even voice phishing. Each method is meticulously crafted to trick the unsuspecting user.
The Anatomy of an Attack: Phishing Kits
It was intriguing to discuss the concept of phishing kits during our session. These are the tools that cybercriminals employ, almost like a DIY kit for scams. From cloning websites to orchestrating sophisticated social media campaigns, these kits are central to the success of a phishing campaign.
Cultural Nuances: How Scams Change with Geography
One aspect that particularly stands out to me is the adaptability of scammers. As we discussed, scams aren’t universal – they adjust and morph based on regional nuances. Local events, traditions, and even a region’s general cybersecurity awareness level can dictate a scammer’s tactics.
The Best Defense? Knowledge and Caution
While technological defenses are essential, I always stress individual awareness. We touched upon the importance of being digitally vigilant, whether it’s double-checking sender details or being skeptical about too-good-to-be-true offers. Organizations have a pivotal role, from cybersecurity training to robust fraud detection systems.

Welcome to the age of Outseer. Through identity science and predictive analytics, we deliver the foresight you need to stop fraudulent transactions before they happen. And we do it without adding even a split-second of friction for legitimate cardholders and customers.
Defeating Digital Transaction Fraud & Friction Has Never Felt So Good
Let me know if this hits home. A Black Swan event stuffs a decade’s worth of digital transformation into 12 months and ignites a $1 trillion increase in digital commerce. But just as much is lost to record fraud during the same time. Do you hope for the best and throttle up revenue? Or take steps to secure your transactions? We say do both.
Welcome to the age of Outseer. Through identity science and predictive analytics, we deliver the foresight you need to stop fraudulent transactions before they happen. And we do it without adding even a split-second of friction for legitimate cardholders and customers.
The upside is all kinds of awesome: Less fraud loss, more transaction approvals, fewer chargebacks, more happy customers. It’s a win-win for everyone but the cybercriminals.
For me personally, there’s another big plus. It’s not every day you get to launch a game-changing new brand that has a 20 year track record of success. With its origins as the Fraud & Risk Intelligence Unit at RSA, Outseer is building on the legacy of an iconic cybersecurity brand. With the digital economy at a critical inflection point, we also couldn’t be doing that at a better time—or for better reasons.
Fraudsters Always Follow the Money
Thanks to COVID-19 related lockdowns and shelter-in-place mandates, consumers have become quite comfortable with purchasing everything from groceries to insurance policies through the web, mobile, IoT, ATMs, IVR and a growing number of other challenges. After topping US$4 trillion in 2020, digital commerce is expected to grow another 50% by 2024, according to Obelo.
But there’s the thing. The same dynamics underlying this seismic shift to digital channels is driving whole new commerce models. Whether it’s voice commerce, scan-and-go payments, or Starbucks offering finance products with your Venti Mocha, transformative new payment models are cropping up every day For banks, credit card issuers, and payment processes, innovation is, innovation is the name of the game.
The bad news: Consumer expectations for safe, seamless transactions through any device or channel they choose has hit the stratosphere. Even worse: That’s the least of your challenges ahead.
With volumes of compromised card and personal data, account login credentials, phishing kits, ransomware and more available for sale or barter on the dark web, they’ll also contend with cybercriminals angling for a slice of a rapidly-growing pie.
Nilsen projected $30.93 billion (or almost $31 billion) in gross fraud losses, with card-not-present (CNP) fraud, including purchases made via mobile devices, associated with ~65% of the fraud losses in 2020. With plenty of saved payment details and loyalty points stored in accounts and apps, account takeover topped US$6 billion last year. The financial and reputational damage done through brand impersonation scams and social engineering is incalculable.
Stopping Criminals, Not Customers
For the team at Outseer, this kind of criminality simply won’t stand. By spinning out on our own, we’re able to laser focus on liberating the world from payments and account fraud. The fact that these same crimes are used as pretext for more sinister drug and human trafficking only motivates us more.
We believe superior transaction experiences shouldn’t come with painful compromise. Or any compromise at all. By harnessing identity science and data from 20 billion annual transactions from a global consortium of 6,000 companies spanning every industry and geography, we’re uniquely able to pinpoint fraudsters and kick their transaction attempts to the curb.
With this approach, we achieve fraud detection rates as high as 95%, and intervention rates as low as 5% or less. Which means banks and card issuers can let the vast majority of transactions sail through uninterrupted, reserving step-up challenges for the very few transactions that warrant closer scrutiny. No other provider comes close.
Outseeing is Believing
To learn more, be sure to watch the explainer in this post. As we continue to introduce Outseer to the world, you can count on plenty of thought leadership, continuous innovation, and the customer successes to show for it
It’s why we call our brand Outseer—our ability to look ahead and predict what’s coming next in a way that surpasses all the rest. By seeing what others can’t, our ability to enable superior transaction experiences will benefit our customers and the entire digital economy like never before possible.

Thanks to COVID-19 related lockdowns and shelter-in-place mandates, consumers have become quite comfortable with purchasing everything from groceries to insurance policies through the web, mobile, IoT, ATMs, IVR and a growing number of other challenges. After topping US$4 trillion in 2020, digital commerce is expected to grow another 50% by 2024, according to Obelo.
But there’s the thing. The same dynamics underlying this seismic shift to digital channels is driving whole new commerce models. Whether it’s voice commerce, scan-and-go payments, or Starbucks offering finance products with your Venti Mocha, transformative new payment models are cropping up every day For banks, credit card issuers, and payment processes, innovation is, innovation is the name of the game.
The bad news: Consumer expectations for safe, seamless transactions through any device or channel they choose has hit the stratosphere. Even worse: That’s the least of your challenges ahead.
With volumes of compromised card and personal data, account login credentials, phishing kits, ransomware and more available for sale or barter on the dark web, they’ll also contend with cybercriminals angling for a slice of a rapidly-growing pie.
Nilsen projected $30.93 billion (or almost $31 billion) in gross fraud losses, with card-not-present (CNP) fraud, including purchases made via mobile devices, associated with ~65% of the fraud losses in 2020. With plenty of saved payment details and loyalty points stored in accounts and apps, account takeover topped US$6 billion last year. The financial and reputational damage done through brand impersonation scams and social engineering is incalculable.
Stopping Criminals, Not Customers
For the team at Outseer, this kind of criminality simply won’t stand. By spinning out on our own, we’re able to laser focus on liberating the world from payments and account fraud. The fact that these same crimes are used as pretext for more sinister drug and human trafficking only motivates us more.
We believe superior transaction experiences shouldn’t come with painful compromise. Or any compromise at all. By harnessing identity science and data from 20 billion annual transactions from a global consortium of 6,000 companies spanning every industry and geography, we’re uniquely able to pinpoint fraudsters and kick their transaction attempts to the curb.
With this approach, we achieve fraud detection rates as high as 95%, and intervention rates as low as 5% or less. Which means banks and card issuers can let the vast majority of transactions sail through uninterrupted, reserving step-up challenges for the very few transactions that warrant closer scrutiny.

Secure API and application security measures can include secure coding practices (SDLC), data encryption, strong authentication and access controls, strong DDoS protection, protection against application attacks and regular security testing and vulnerability assessments. It is also essential to have clear policies and protocols in place for managing API access, monitoring activity, and responding to security incidents. Service providers must also ensure that third-party applications and services that use their APIs comply with strict security protocols and adhere to industry standards. With effective API and application security measures in place, service providers can protect sensitive customer data, maintain the integrity of their applications, and minimize the risk of security incidents.
5. Investing in Cybersecurity Solutions
Investing in cybersecurity solutions is essential to protect banking software and service environments from cyber-attacks. Banks should deploy advanced security solutions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions. These solutions will help detect and prevent unauthorized access to banking software and mitigate potential security threats.
6. Data Protection as a lifestyle
Data protection is a critical concern in the entire financial sector, as they handle vast amounts of sensitive personal and financial information on a daily basis. Service providers and well as banks must implement robust data protection policies and procedures, including encryption, access controls, and regular security audits, to safeguard customer data. Additionally, service providers must train their employees on data protection best practices and ensure that all third-party vendors and partners also comply with data protection regulations. Failure to adequately protect customer data can result in severe legal and reputational consequences, including financial penalties, loss of trust, and damage to the company brand image. Therefore, data protection is an essential aspect of banking operations that must be taken seriously to protect both customers, service providers and the bank itself.
7. Endpoint Detection and Response and Incident Response Automation
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and incident response automation are crucial tools for all organizations to quickly detect and respond to security incidents. EDR solutions monitor endpoints such as servers, personal computers, and mobile devices, detecting suspicious activity and alerting security teams to potential threats. Incident response automation streamlines the response process by automating repetitive tasks, such as collecting and analyzing data, and initiating incident response workflows. With automation, security teams can quickly investigate and respond to security incidents, minimizing the risk of data loss and business disruption. Organizations can also use automation to improve incident response planning by running simulations and identifying potential weaknesses in their response strategies. By combining EDR with incident response automation, organizations can detect and respond to security incidents more quickly and effectively, reducing the impact of attacks and mitigating the risk of future incidents.

Demystifying Peer-to-Peer Payments & Exploring National Schemes in the UK and US | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/demystifying-peer-to-peer-payments-exploring-national-schemes-in-the-uk-and-us,2023-09-13,"Demystifying Peer-to-Peer Payments & Exploring National Schemes in the UK and US
Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments have revolutionized the way we transfer money, but they also introduce new challenges, especially in terms of fraud risks. In this blog post, we will explore the intricacies of P2P payments, delve into the national schemes of Faster Payments (FP) in the UK and FedNow in the US, and shed light on the potential fraud vulnerabilities associated with instant transactions. By understanding these risks and adopting appropriate measures, we can ensure the security and integrity of P2P payments.
Understanding P2P Payments
P2P payments facilitate seamless and instant transactions directly between individuals, eliminating the need for intermediaries. They offer advantages such as speed, low friction, and cost-effectiveness. However, this convenience comes with a heightened risk of fraud due to the irrevocable nature of instant payments.
- The UK’s Faster Payments Scheme – in the UK, Faster Payments is a national scheme that enables instant transactions between banks. Settlement occurs multiple times a day in a net settlement model. While this system provides efficiency, it also requires careful liquidity management and poses risks if something goes wrong, potentially leading to a halt in all payments.
- The US’s FedNow and Private Fixes – the US has introduced FedNow, a national scheme aimed at enabling instant settlement through a gross model. However, private solutions such as Venmo and Zelle have gained popularity. These platforms, adopted by some banks, offer instant P2P transfers. However, their rapid growth has also exposed vulnerabilities and inconsistencies in consumer protection against scams and fraudulent activities.
Fraud Risks in P2P Payments
The nature of P2P payments amplifies the risks associated with fraud. Scammers exploit the irrevocable nature of instant payments, making it crucial for users to exercise caution. For example, Zelle payments have experienced significant growth, in 2021 Zelle transacted $490 billion worth of payments, but consumer protections are still being refined. Scammers set up accounts linked to the receiving end of the payment, tricking users into sending cash that cannot be recovered easily.
Addressing the Problem
Recognizing the urgency to protect consumers, lawmakers are pressuring banks to take more responsibility and establish consistent reimbursement policies for P2P payment scams. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is preparing new guidance that could require banks to refund scammed consumers. Major banks supporting Zelle are collaborating to create remedies for scammed users, but limitations exist, especially concerning reimbursement for goods or services not received.
In the UK, the Payments System Regulator has officially announced additional obligations concerning the reimbursement of APP fraud. This development specifically impacts various faster payment systems worldwide, with notable attention from the Australian government, which has already expressed interest in implementing similar legislation. The effective date for this new reimbursement requirement is set for 2024.
Adapting to Secure P2P Payments
As the P2P payment landscape continues to evolve, it is essential for financial institutions and users to adapt their processes and reporting mechanisms. Embracing innovative technologies, implementing secure authorization protocols, and establishing consistent consumer protections can help mitigate fraud risks and maintain the integrity of P2P payment systems.
Crucial to Remain Vigilant
While P2P payments offer convenience and efficiency, it is crucial to be aware of the potential fraud risks involved. Understanding the underlying concepts, such as settlement models and participation models, can provide clarity and inform decision-making. By remaining vigilant, adopting secure practices, and supporting consistent consumer protections, we can safeguard P2P payments and ensure a trusted and reliable financial landscape for all.",,"fraud, scam",2,2023-09-13,"Demystifying Peer-to-Peer Payments & Exploring National Schemes in the UK and US | Outseer.

Detecting Intent: The Future of Fraud Prevention in an Agentic World | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/detecting-intent-ai-fraud-prevention,2025-11-04,"Detecting Intent: The Future of Fraud Prevention in an Agentic World
Automation is changing what it means to be a customer. As AI begins to act on our behalf, fraud prevention must evolve from spotting human behaviour to understanding human intent.
For years, fraud systems have been built on one simple assumption…
There’s a human at the other end.
They track how we type, swipe, and hesitate. They build trust over time through familiar devices and patterns of behaviour, location and financial activity. But that assumption is starting to break, because increasingly, there isn’t a human at the other end at all.
Traditionally, that was the strongest indicator of fraud. For years, fraudsters scaled their operations by automating attacks; using bots, scripts, and more recently, AI. to mimic human behaviour at scale. Now, those same signals are appearing in legitimate customer journeys as consumers delegate everyday actions like shopping, booking travel, and making payments to AI agents that act on their behalf.
And that’s where things get messy.
The Rise of the Digital Delegate
Autonomous AI assistants are becoming part of daily digital life; tools that can browse, fill forms, and complete checkouts without the user ever touching a keyboard.
For financial institutions and merchants, that convenience introduces a new challenge.
Fraud systems built to recognise human input now must interpret activity generated by machines.
That shift blurs many of the signals that fraud detection depends on:
- Behavioural biometrics become less reliable, because AI doesn’t pause or hesitate.
- Device fingerprinting loses accuracy, as transactions originate from cloud infrastructure rather than a known customer device.
- Velocity and session checks begin to show the same smooth patterns whether the activity is legitimate or malicious.
And when the activity is delegated to an agent running outside the user’s environment, in-session authentication becomes impossible. There is no biometric prompt, no challenge screen, and no trusted device context to confirm who is truly acting. Traditional step-ups can’t be triggered because the human isn’t in the loop.
The result is a widening blind spot; not because systems stop working, but because they’re now observing the wrong kind of behaviour.
When Fraud Looks Legitimate
As digital interactions become more automated, the boundary between authorised and unauthorised actions is starting to blur.
Fraudsters are learning to exploit legitimate automation rather than break it, blending their activities into the same channels customers use. At the same time, genuine users are approving transactions that they never personally initiate.
That creates a new question for fraud teams: not “is this a human?”, but “is this my customer’s intent?”
Understanding intent, and whether a decision truly belongs to the user, will define the next era of fraud prevention.
From Behaviour to Intent
Where behaviour tells us how a person acts, intent reveals why.
Modern fraud strategies need to understand that distinction. A genuine AI-driven transaction may follow every technical rule of a secure session, but if the intent behind it has been hijacked, trust is still broken.
Future fraud detection must evolve to assess:
- Identity and Provenance – verifying who or what is initiating the action.
- Intent and Consent – determining whether the customer authorised it.
- Context and Continuity – connecting each event to the broader behavioural and transactional story.
It’s no longer enough to detect the actor. We must understand the intention behind the act.
Redefining Trust in a Machine-Mediated World
At Outseer, we’re exploring how to detect authentic intent, not just human behaviour, by combining:
- Device intelligence that identifies the origin and trustworthiness of each session.
- Behavioural analytics that learn from the customer’s evolving digital patterns.
- Adaptive risk context that interprets signals in real time through our advanced risk engine.
- Payment intelligence that analyses both incoming and outgoing transaction patterns to spot subtle deviations that indicate manipulation or automation; mapping how funds flow, how often, and to whom.
By correlating these payment signals with behavioural and device data, Outseer can distinguish between genuine customer activity and automated actions disguised as routine transactions.
This approach ensures trust can persist, even when digital assistants or delegated systems perform actions on behalf of users.
A New Definition of Consent
Emerging regulation is already beginning to account for this shift.
Under PSD3 and the upcoming EU Payment Services Regulation, new technical standards will define how consent, authentication, and liability are handled when services act on a user’s behalf.
Meanwhile, eIDAS 2.0 and the European Digital Identity Wallet will give citizens verified credentials that can authorise payments, sign documents, and authenticate identity across platforms. The UK is now following suit with the recently announced Digital ID scheme.
We can already see early examples of delegated trust in Open Banking, where a customer gives a licensed fintech permission to access their account or initiate payments. In those journeys, the bank never sees the customer directly; it relies on a secure consent token passed through the regulated ecosystem. The same principle could extend to AI-driven agents acting on behalf of users, demanding equally strong proof of consent and liability boundaries.
These frameworks will lay the groundwork for trusted delegation; creating a provable consent trail that travels with every digital action.
The question for the industry will be: When AI acts on a user’s behalf, how do we prove that consent was truly informed and deliberate?
Preparing for the Agent Economy
Analysts predict that by the end of this decade, more than half of digital interactions will be automated or assisted by AI.
If even a small share of those involves payments or sensitive data, the implications for fraud detection are profound; not just for stopping fraud, but for keeping genuine transactions flowing.
When risk systems fail to recognise legitimate AI-assisted actions, the impact cascades quickly: false declines rise, call centres flood with complaints, and customers miss out on purchases they genuinely intended to make. For merchants, that means lost sales, damaged trust, and abandoned carts at unprecedented scale.
The path forward is clear:
- Anchor trust at the level of identity and intent.
- Design risk engines that adapt to delegated actions.
- Ensure consent remains verifiable, even when automated.
Fraud prevention has always been about understanding people. Now, it’s about understanding the relationship between people’s intentions, and the machines that act for them.
Because the future of fraud detection isn’t about the signals alone: behaviour, biometrics, devices, location, payments, money movement. Understanding fraud, and protecting genuine customers, means being able to ask why this action happened, and who it truly represents.
It’s part of a broader Outseer vision: to build a platformized approach that addresses the evolving challenges of fraud prevention. The platform unifies native signals that work in concert to reveal the true context of each transaction, combines AI-driven risk scoring with advanced science in its decisioning layers, and helps you stay ahead of major shifts such as the rise of agentic AI.

Meanwhile, eIDAS 2.0 and the European Digital Identity Wallet will give citizens verified credentials that can authorise payments, sign documents, and authenticate identity across platforms. The UK is now following suit with the recently announced Digital ID scheme.
We can already see early examples of delegated trust in Open Banking, where a customer gives a licensed fintech permission to access their account or initiate payments. In those journeys, the bank never sees the customer directly; it relies on a secure consent token passed through the regulated ecosystem. The same principle could extend to AI-driven agents acting on behalf of users, demanding equally strong proof of consent and liability boundaries.
These frameworks will lay the groundwork for trusted delegation; creating a provable consent trail that travels with every digital action.
The question for the industry will be: When AI acts on a user’s behalf, how do we prove that consent was truly informed and deliberate?
Preparing for the Agent Economy
Analysts predict that by the end of this decade, more than half of digital interactions will be automated or assisted by AI.
If even a small share of those involves payments or sensitive data, the implications for fraud detection are profound; not just for stopping fraud, but for keeping genuine transactions flowing.
When risk systems fail to recognise legitimate AI-assisted actions, the impact cascades quickly: false declines rise, call centres flood with complaints, and customers miss out on purchases they genuinely intended to make. For merchants, that means lost sales, damaged trust, and abandoned carts at unprecedented scale.
The path forward is clear:
- Anchor trust at the level of identity and intent.
- Design risk engines that adapt to delegated actions.
- Ensure consent remains verifiable, even when automated.
Fraud prevention has always been about understanding people. Now, it’s about understanding the relationship between people’s intentions, and the machines that act for them.
Because the future of fraud detection isn’t about the signals alone: behaviour, biometrics, devices, location, payments, money movement. Understanding fraud, and protecting genuine customers, means being able to ask why this action happened, and who it truly represents.
It’s part of a broader Outseer vision: to build a platformized approach that addresses the evolving challenges of fraud prevention. The platform unifies native signals that work in concert to reveal the true context of each transaction, combines AI-driven risk scoring with advanced science in its decisioning layers, and helps you stay ahead of major shifts such as the rise of agentic AI.

"Digital Fraud: What It Is, How It Works & Why It Matters | Outseer",https://www.outseer.com/blog/digital-fraud,2022-05-06,"Digital Fraud: What It Is, How It Works & Why It Matters
Concerned about digital fraud? We explain what digital fraud is, how it affects eCommerce, and strategies for digital fraud prevention and detection.
What Is Digital Fraud?
Digital fraud entails the use of phishing emails, phony websites, bogus mobile apps, fake social media profiles, and other mechanisms to illegally obtain information and defraud consumers and businesses.
Before we dive into how these digital fraud schemes work, let’s explore why digital fraud is on the rise and examine the impact these attacks have on both consumers and businesses.
Digital Fraud Trends
Digital fraud has been a burden for businesses since the creation of e-commerce in the 1990s. As time has passed digital fraudsters have only become more sophisticated in avoiding detection and carrying out their scams.
Today, fraud prevention technologies are available to help organizations stay ahead of cybercriminals in this digital game of cat and mouse. By combining machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics, fraud prevention platforms can prevent digital fraud attacks and protect their customers as threats evolve.
Yet despite these advancements, digital fraud has been on the rise, especially in recent years. Here are the top digital fraud trends you should know about.
Fraudsters Are Relying on Mobile Apps to Commit Banking Fraud
Mobile phones have become a perceived safe place in our personal lives, especially among Gen Z. But in 2021, 68% of digital banking fraud originated on mobile platforms. As mobile technology improves, we see attackers targeting mobile channels more than traditional desktop applications. Fraudsters are increasingly exploiting mobile malware and uploading rogue apps designed to impersonate well-known brands to trusted app stores—exploiting the popularity of mobile banking to steal account information.
Brand Impersonation Now Makes up Nearly Half of All Digital Fraud Attacks
By the fourth quarter of 2021, brand abuse attacks made up 45% of all digital fraud worldwide—a 274% increase over the preceding three quarters. For criminals, brand abuse is easy to carry out. Websites, logos, and other brand identity assets can easily be cloned to trick unsuspecting customers. Many of these attacks occur in countries where there is little risk of getting apprehended.
Cryptocurrency Fraud Is Climbing Fast
Cryptocurrency is akin to the Wild West when compared to highly-regulated currencies and equities, making it a lucrative target for fraudsters. In fact, cryptocurrency fraud has exploded in recent years, fueled by greed and FOMO (the fear of missing out), making it one of the fastest growing digital crimes. According to the Federal Trade Commission, US consumers lost $750 million to crypto scams in 2021. And Chainalysis reports that worldwide losses may topped $3.2 billion—a 516% increase from the previous year. Even in a bear market, we anticipate cryptocurrency fraud will continue to climb in the coming years.
Buy Now, Pay Later Fraud Is Pacing Customer Demand
Buy now, pay later services help businesses increase their average order value by allowing customers to finance their purchases through a zero-interest line of credit. According to Insider Intelligence, global buy now, pay later spend is on track to hit $680 billion in volume by 2025. Fraudsters have taken notice of this trend and are actively harvesting login credentials in account takeover (ATO) schemes and using synthetic identities to create fake accounts in order to establish BNPL lines of credit.
Phishing Continues to Grease the Wheels of Digital Fraud
These and many other forms of digital fraud often involve phishing scams, which continue to be distressingly successful. Gone are the typo-laden missives of yesteryear. Today, fraudsters leverage AI technologies and sophisticated social engineering techniques to steal information from unsuspecting recipients via email, phone call (vishing), SMS text (smishing), and more.
Digital Fraud Examples
Digital fraud isn’t disappearing anytime soon. We often see fraudsters cycle through different attacks and switch up their tactics in response to fraud detection systems. Some common examples of digital fraud include the following:
- Account Takeover – Attackers hijack customer accounts to drain bank accounts, apply for credit, steal personal information, and make unauthorized purchases.
- Brand Abuse – Fake emails, websites, and messages that trick victims into sharing login credentials or other personal information with the attacker.
- Card-Not-Present (CNP) Fraud – Unauthorized purchases made with credit card information without the cardholder’s knowledge.
- Chargeback Fraud – When a legitimate customer makes a purchase with the sole intent of issuing a chargeback—keeping their money and the product.
- Cryptocurrency Fraud – Attackers target exchanges to steal crypto or create fake projects in order to cashing out user investments before anyone can make a profit.
- Rogue Mobile Apps – Fake apps that impersonate brands to steal card or account information from customers.
- Enrollment Fraud – The use of synthetic identities to open accounts or lines of credit from which to make illegal purchases without ever paying them off.
Digital Fraud Prevention Strategies
As you can see, digital fraud is a blanket term that encompasses many channels, targets, and tactics. Thankfully, there are solutions and best practices you can implement to protect both your organization and its customers.
Use Machine Learning and AI to Stay Ahead of Threats
Modern machine learning has proven to be instrumental in preventing digital fraud loss by understanding the behavior behind an attack. This technology works by studying normative customer behavior and looking for deviations that may signal fraud.
Today’s most robust fraud management platforms enable organizations set their risk tolerance and gain insight into the types of attacks they face. When a certain behavior is deemed high risk, that user must provide additional authentication before proceeding. This strategy allows companies to only filter out highly suspicious users, leaving the majority of regular customers uninterrupted.
Prevent Digital Brand Abuse
Phishing is the predominant method used by fraudsters to steal sensitive information and gain access to user accounts and systems. The best way to combat phishing is to take a proactive approach by sourcing a comprehensive, 24/7 brand monitoring and takedown service.
By continuously scanning the web, app stores, and social media, leading solutions immediately recognize brand impersonation attacks and take steps to immediately have the phishing sites, apps, and social media profiles behind the scams taken down before they cause serious financial and reputational harm.
Organizations should also consider using an email gateway or firewall solution to filter inbound phishing emails that evade early detection and prevent them from reaching staff. These strategies combined with continuous education can keep both your customer and staff free from phishing fraud.

eCommerce Fraud Prevention: Top Strategies for Your Company | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/ecommerce-fraud-prevention,2021-11-02,"eCommerce Fraud Prevention: Top Strategies for Your Company
Wondering about eCommerce Fraud Prevention? We explain what eCommerce fraud is, and discuss the best strategies for prevention.
What Is eCommerce Fraud Prevention?
eCommerce Fraud Is any fraud perpetrated on an ecommerce site or platform. E-commerce fraud prevention is the implementation of strategies for detecting high-risk transactions and preventing fraud. Measures include PCI compliance, AI and machine learning, risk-based monitoring, and more.
Thanks in part to the dramatic shift to online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic, e-commerce fraud could cost online merchants as much as $20 billion for the full year 2021, according to Juniper Research. And it’s easy to see why.
From a criminal perspective, it’s a low-risk, high-value proposition. In the past, fraudsters would have to physically steal credit and cards and use them in brick-and-mortar stores or over the phone. Today, they can easily and inexpensively acquire stolen card details and other credentials through dark web marketplaces. This level of convenience combined with multiple layers of anonymity makes e-commerce fraud extremely attractive to cybercriminals.
Types of eCommerce Fraud
Over the years, fraud has evolved beyond simply exploiting stolen cardholder data. Today, criminals have many ways to carry out e-commerce fraud, with some being much harder to detect and prevent than others. Here’s a look at a few of the most common forms of e-commerce fraud.
CNP Fraud
Card Not Present (CNP) fraud occurs when a criminal makes an illicit purchase without physical possession of the payment card.
Almost all e-commerce sites require a Card Verification Value (CVV) to prove card ownership, but that’s not always enough. As mentioned, crooks gain access to full card details through dark web marketplaces. They also steal this information directly, through phishing scams.
Fraud prevention methods like CVV and Address Verification Service (AVS) can stop some fraud, but not all of it. CVV codes are often included in stolen data dumps and retrieved from phishing campaigns, while AVS can be bypassed by a few minutes of online research.
Organizations can take steps to prevent CNP fraud by:
- Implementing anti-fraud tools that leverage the EMV® 3-D Secure payment protocol
- Keeping e-commerce tools, domains, and websites up to date
- Taking down phishing sites before they harm your brand
- Limit or block exposure to risky geographic locations
- Verifying billing addresses through AVS and credit cards with CVVs
Chargeback Fraud
Chargeback fraud occurs when a customer receives the product they paid for, but then initiates a chargeback with the intention to keep both their money and the item. This fraud can be tough to identify because the excuse for a chargeback can vary in each case. For example, fraudsters can claim they never received the item or lie to card issuers by claiming they never made the purchase in the first place.
When chargeback fraud is done by accident, it’s often referred to as “friendly” fraud. Sometimes customers forget they placed an order, fail to recognize a charge on their statement, or think that a chargeback is another way to initiate a return. Either way, it still hurts revenue, impacts inventory—and is often avoidable.
Organizations can prevent chargeback and friendly fraud by doing the following:
- Using strong credit card verification methods to identify repeat offenders
- Identifying fraudulent behavior through machine learning
- Providing order confirmation emails
- Making return policies easy to find and understand
- Using clear transaction descriptions
Account Takeover Fraud (ATO Fraud)
ATO fraud happens when a criminal hijacks a legitimate customer account and uses that account to commit fraud. Fraudsters often attempt to make purchases, drain reward points, make large transfers, and more. ATO attacks now lead to more than $16 billion in annual loss just in the US, up 300% from 2019. This form of fraud is also tough to spot, since the intruder is logging in as a verified customer.
Account information is primarily stolen through phishing scams, where victims will unknowingly attempt to log in to a malicious clone of a trusted site. These sites can look indistinguishable from the legitimate company they impersonate and even redirect users to the company’s real site once their information is stolen.
Compromised accounts impact revenue, but also quickly erode the trust between the customer and the brand. Even if the customer was careless with their account information, it’s up to the e-commerce platform to identify ATO based on behavior.
Machine learning-based risk decisioning is one of the best ways to prevent an account takeover. By monitoring metrics such as geolocation, session data, and device ID, e-commerce platforms can quickly identify suspicious login attempts and prevent fraud entirely.
Organizations can prevent ATO fraud by the doing the following:
- Protecting customers through risk-based account monitoring
- Supporting Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Proactively taking down phishing sites before they steal your customer’s data
- Setting limits on login attempts
Mail Interception Fraud
Mail interception fraud occurs when a criminal uses a stolen credit card or hijacked account to make a purchase that ships to the cardholder’s legitimate address. Once the order is placed, the fraudster will quickly call customer service at the business or its shipping company to change the address or arrange for pick-up at the shipping company’s distribution center.
This technique is used to bypass address verification checks and avoid fraud detection systems. Luckily, this type of fraud is easy to prevent by leveraging machine learning and implementing rigorous procedures for changing account information.
Organizations can prevent mail interception fraud by doing the following:
- Using robust payment security to prevent the transaction
- Training customer service to identify interception fraud
- Requiring additional authentication when making changes to orders or account information
Account Enrollment Fraud
Why take over an account when you can use stolen card information to set up an account or rewards program with an online merchant from scratch?
Today, the volume of stolen and synthetic identity information is climbing fast, with losses stemming from identity theft surging 42% in 2020, according to Aite Group. The Federal Trade Commission reports that as much as 88% of credit card fraud in the US now consists of thieves opening up new accounts.
In these attacks, fraudsters open an account or activate a mobile app using pilfered card information. Since the new user appears legitimate, there is no discrepancy between shipping addresses or contact information—helping them bypass most traditional fraud detection systems.
Organizations can prevent account enrollment fraud by:
- Requiring multiple forms of identity proof and running it through external databases
- Deploying solutions that leverage machine learning and identity science to correlate and verify physical and digital identities
Brand Impersonation
Brand impersonation is now implicated in 49% of all fraud attacks worldwide. Brand abuse is by far the most prominent attack vector for cybercriminals due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Cybercriminals steal brand images, company assets, and register closely related domain names in order to trick unsuspecting customers.
Brand impersonation is most prevalent in social media- and email-based phishing campaigns, but can also be found in text messages and increasingly, fraudulent brand mobile apps. In these scams, fraudsters leverage the stolen brand’s reputation to bamboozle victims out of their money and harvest their card details.
Brand abuse is costly to both consumers and e-commerce merchants. Consumers stand to lose not only their money through a fake purchase, but also their payment and shipping information. This stolen information is typically used to perpetrate CNP fraud or is sold to others on the dark web.
Consumers often don’t understand how the attack was carried out and hold the brand responsible. This loss of customer trust can lead to negative reviews and news reports that render a brand’s legitimate mobile apps and email and social media communications radioactive to leery customers and prospects—hobbling critical revenue channels. Prevention is vital when combating brand abuse as larger companies are often targeted more frequently.
Organizations can prevent brand abuse by doing the following:
- Setting up proactive brand abuse monitoring and takedown services
- Implementing strong email security such as DKIM, SPF, and DMARC
- Educating staff and customers on identifying fraudulent messaging
- Using email filtering to protect your network from phishing attacks
Identifying Fraud in Your E-commerce Business
Fraud is an evolving game of cat and mouse, but by identifying the telltale signs of fraud, prevention systems can be built to automatically stop new attacks.
Here are a few risk factors that could indicate e-commerce fraud:
- New device login for an existing account
- Unusual login location
- Mismatched shipping/billing address
- Large purchases of the same product in a single transaction
- Numerous separate orders placed in quick succession
- Multiple orders to the same address with different cards
- The consumer is using a brand new email address
To automate fraud detection, merchants can leverage machine learning algorithms to identify these and other red flags.
How to Prevent E-commerce Fraud
Identifying fraud is only half the battle; it takes proactive measures to recognize high-risk users and activities and prevent fraudulent transactions before they even happen. Let’s review some steps you can take to prevent e-commerce fraud.
Define Your Strategy
Understanding your fraud and risk tolerance is key in fraud prevention. For card issuers, banks, and merchants, it’s critical that each channel should have appropriate layers of protection, backed by policies that balance fraud prevention and user experience in accordance with your tolerance. Do you throttle up fraud prevention to avoid loss at the risk of customers defecting to competitors? Or do you prioritize customer experience to outplay rivals while risking serious damage to your bottom line? The best solutions will have strategies for each channel that stop fraud while preserving the customer experience.
Follow PCI Standards
Following the Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards keep merchants in line with best data security practices and legal requirements. These standards help identify weaknesses in fraud protection through self-assessments and official audits conducted by Qualified Security Assessors.
There are 12 key steps that can help merchants easily achieve PCI compliance:
- Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data.
- Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.
- Protect stored cardholder data.
- Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.
- Use and regularly update antivirus software or programs.
- Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.
- Restrict access to cardholder data on a need-to-know basis.
- Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access.
- Restrict physical access to cardholder data.
- Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.
- Regularly test security systems and processes.
- Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel.
Implement Layers of Security Throughout the Perimeter—and Beyond
There is no single foolproof solution to e-commerce fraud. Merchants should strategically deploy layers of technology that together create a web of interconnected safeguards. For instance, card issuers, banks, payment processors and merchants should all deploy tools that enhance features built into the EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS) payment standard to prevent transaction fraud.
Using our own product as an example, Outseer 3-D Secure builds upon the 3DS standard by combining it with advanced identity science and shared intelligence from global, cross-industry transaction data to prevent CNP fraud. Merchants around the world leveraged our technology to protect more than $100 billion in CNP transactions in just the first half of 2021.
Likewise, merchants can leverage email standards such as DMARC help prevent phishing-based brand impersonation attacks, and brand abuse monitoring and takedown services like Outseer FraudAction to shut down the sites (as well as imposter apps and social media pages) used to harvest login and payment credentials from the victims in these attacks.
Put Data Science and Machine Learning to Work Across All Channels
Advancements in machine learning and big data analytics present one of the best ways to proactively counter e-commerce fraud when transactions may occur across the web, mobile, IoT, API, voice, or any number of other channels.
Case in point: Outseer Fraud Manager, which analyzes behavior and cross-references it with offline and online digital identities and transaction data spanning every industry and geography, to detect fraudulent transactions, logins and new account enrollments and prevent e-commerce fraud across any channel.
Stop Fraud, Not Customers
Of course, there’s one other factor central to e-commerce fraud prevention strategies: the customer experience. At a time when shopping cart abandonment continues to impact 75% of all purchases, leading to $4 trillion in lost revenue potential each year, adding any customer friction to prevent fraud is a gamble.
Unlike traditional anti-fraud solutions, Outseer products read between the lines to understand how legitimate customers behave—stopping 95% of all fraud loss while reserving step-up challenges for the scant 5% of transactions that ever require intervention. That’s the best performance in the industry.
With Outseer, checkout times are reduced by 85% and cart abandonment by 70% while fueling consumer confidence and loyalty. Which means a whole lot more revenue for merchants, banks, card issuers and payment processors. And a whole lot less for fraudsters.

- Deploying solutions that leverage machine learning and identity science to correlate and verify physical and digital identities
Brand Impersonation
Brand impersonation is now implicated in 49% of all fraud attacks worldwide. Brand abuse is by far the most prominent attack vector for cybercriminals due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Cybercriminals steal brand images, company assets, and register closely related domain names in order to trick unsuspecting customers.
Brand impersonation is most prevalent in social media- and email-based phishing campaigns, but can also be found in text messages and increasingly, fraudulent brand mobile apps. In these scams, fraudsters leverage the stolen brand’s reputation to bamboozle victims out of their money and harvest their card details.
Brand abuse is costly to both consumers and e-commerce merchants. Consumers stand to lose not only their money through a fake purchase, but also their payment and shipping information. This stolen information is typically used to perpetrate CNP fraud or is sold to others on the dark web.
Consumers often don’t understand how the attack was carried out and hold the brand responsible. This loss of customer trust can lead to negative reviews and news reports that render a brand’s legitimate mobile apps and email and social media communications radioactive to leery customers and prospects—hobbling critical revenue channels. Prevention is vital when combating brand abuse as larger companies are often targeted more frequently.
Organizations can prevent brand abuse by doing the following:
- Setting up proactive brand abuse monitoring and takedown services
- Implementing strong email security such as DKIM, SPF, and DMARC
- Educating staff and customers on identifying fraudulent messaging
- Using email filtering to protect your network from phishing attacks
Identifying Fraud in Your E-commerce Business
Fraud is an evolving game of cat and mouse, but by identifying the telltale signs of fraud, prevention systems can be built to automatically stop new attacks.
Here are a few risk factors that could indicate e-commerce fraud:
- New device login for an existing account
- Unusual login location
- Mismatched shipping/billing address
- Large purchases of the same product in a single transaction
- Numerous separate orders placed in quick succession
- Multiple orders to the same address with different cards
- The consumer is using a brand new email address
To automate fraud detection, merchants can leverage machine learning algorithms to identify these and other red flags.
How to Prevent E-commerce Fraud
Identifying fraud is only half the battle; it takes proactive measures to recognize high-risk users and activities and prevent fraudulent transactions before they even happen. Let’s review some steps you can take to prevent e-commerce fraud.
Define Your Strategy
Understanding your fraud and risk tolerance is key in fraud prevention. For card issuers, banks, and merchants, it’s critical that each channel should have appropriate layers of protection, backed by policies that balance fraud prevention and user experience in accordance with your tolerance. Do you throttle up fraud prevention to avoid loss at the risk of customers defecting to competitors? Or do you prioritize customer experience to outplay rivals while risking serious damage to your bottom line? The best solutions will have strategies for each channel that stop fraud while preserving the customer experience.
Follow PCI Standards
Following the Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards keep merchants in line with best data security practices and legal requirements. These standards help identify weaknesses in fraud protection through self-assessments and official audits conducted by Qualified Security Assessors.
There are 12 key steps that can help merchants easily achieve PCI compliance:
- Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data.
- Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.
- Protect stored cardholder data.
- Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.
- Use and regularly update antivirus software or programs.
- Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.
- Restrict access to cardholder data on a need-to-know basis.
- Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access.
- Restrict physical access to cardholder data.
- Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.
- Regularly test security systems and processes.
- Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel.
Implement Layers of Security Throughout the Perimeter—and Beyond
There is no single foolproof solution to e-commerce fraud. Merchants should strategically deploy layers of technology that together create a web of interconnected safeguards. For instance, card issuers, banks, payment processors and merchants should all deploy tools that enhance features built into the EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS) payment standard to prevent transaction fraud.
Using our own product as an example, Outseer 3-D Secure builds upon the 3DS standard by combining it with advanced identity science and shared intelligence from global, cross-industry transaction data to prevent CNP fraud. Merchants around the world leveraged our technology to protect more than $100 billion in CNP transactions in just the first half of 2021.
Likewise, merchants can leverage email standards such as DMARC help prevent phishing-based brand impersonation attacks, and brand abuse monitoring and takedown services like Outseer FraudAction to shut down the sites (as well as imposter apps and social media pages) used to harvest login and payment credentials from the victims in these attacks.
Put Data Science and Machine Learning to Work Across All Channels
Advancements in machine learning and big data analytics present one of the best ways to proactively counter e-commerce fraud when transactions may occur across the web, mobile, IoT, API, voice, or any number of other channels.
Case in point: Outseer Fraud Manager, which analyzes behavior and cross-references it with offline and online digital identities and transaction data spanning every industry and geography, to detect fraudulent transactions, logins and new account enrollments and prevent e-commerce fraud across any channel.
Stop Fraud, Not Customers
Of course, there’s one other factor central to e-commerce fraud prevention strategies: the customer experience. At a time when shopping cart abandonment continues to impact 75% of all purchases, leading to $4 trillion in lost revenue potential each year, adding any customer friction to prevent fraud is a gamble.
Unlike traditional anti-fraud solutions, Outseer products read between the lines to understand how legitimate customers behave—stopping 95% of all fraud loss while reserving step-up challenges for the scant 5% of transactions that ever require intervention. That’s the best performance in the industry.
With Outseer, checkout times are reduced by 85% and cart abandonment by 70% while fueling consumer confidence and loyalty. Which means a whole lot more revenue for merchants, banks, card issuers and payment processors. And a whole lot less for fraudsters.

E-Commerce Fraud Protection: An Essential Guide | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/ecommerce-fraud-protection,2022-03-30,"E-Commerce Fraud Protection: An Essential Guide
We explain what e-commerce fraud is, the types of e-commerce fraud, how it happens, and top strategies for protecting your organization and your customers.
What is E-Commerce Fraud Protection?
E-commerce fraud is any type of fraud perpetrated on a retail site or platform, including credit card fraud, identity theft, account takeover, and chargeback fraud. E-commerce fraud protection detects attempted fraudulent activity with strategies such as real-time monitoring, machine learning, and card security requirements.
What Is E-Commerce Fraud?
E-commerce fraud is a type of fraud that targets online merchants with the goal of stealing information, making fraudulent transactions, or obtaining goods for free.
As more businesses shift to online retail fraudsters are following the money. Card-not-present (CNP) fraud and account takeovers continue to cause millions in losses each year. Thanks to the growing number of stolen credit card and login details available through dark web marketplaces, these forms of e-commerce fraud are extremely attractive to cybercriminals.
But popular new forms of instant credit payments such as Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) have also attracted the attention of cybercriminals seeking to make illegal transactions.
In 2021 alone e-commerce losses due to payment fraud topped $20 billion, a 14% increase from the previous year. It’s clear that consumers will continue to rely on e-commerce, and online retailers will have to take a proactive approach to e-commerce fraud protection.
Types of E-Commerce Fraud
E-commerce fraud goes well beyond stolen credit card details. Below we’ll explain some of the most common forms of e-commerce fraud and provide ways you can defend against them.
Card Not Present (CNP) Fraud
Card-not-present fraud occurs when a person makes an unauthorized purchase using stolen credit card information without physical access to the card. CNP fraud can occur anywhere a merchant cannot inspect the physical card.
In addition to dark web marketplaces, fraudsters also acquire credit card information through phishing scams that trick users into entering their payment information into a cloned version of a legitimate e-commerce website. Once the victim enters their payment details, the information is sent to the attackers who then sell them or use them to make fraudulent purchases.
Fraud prevention methods like CVV and Address Verification Service (AVS) can stop some of this fraud, but not all of it. CVV codes are often included in stolen data dumps and retrieved from phishing campaigns, while AVS can be bypassed by a few minutes of online research.
What You Can Do:
- Implement anti-fraud tools that leverage the EMV® 3-D Secure payment protocol
- Keep e-commerce tools, domains, and websites up to date
- Take down phishing sites that impersonate your brand to steal customer payment details
- Limit or block exposure to risky geographic locations
Chargeback Fraud
Chargeback fraud occurs when a purchaser buys a product with the sole intention of initiating a refund and keeping the product. Rather than contacting the online retailer, the customer goes directly to their payment processor to initiate a refund.
When chargeback fraud is done by accident, it’s often referred to as “friendly” fraud. Sometimes customers forget they placed an order, fail to recognize a charge on their statement, or think that a chargeback is another way to initiate a return. Either way, it still hurts revenue, impacts inventory—and is often avoidable.
When chargeback fraud is purposeful, the perpetrator will state they never received the package or claim they never authorized that purchase. When a chargeback occurs the customer is refunded their money and the business is hit with a chargeback fee.
Chargeback fees can quickly cut into a business’s profits. In 2021, Merchants refunded $25.3 billion in fraudulent returns. According to a recent survey, 44% of merchants report experiencing return abuse of some kind over the past 12 months, and 66% say it has been getting worse.
What You Can Do:
- Make return policies easy to find and understand
- Use clear transaction descriptions for credit card statements
- Send auto-renewal reminders and order confirmations when payments have been made
- Apply strong credit card verification methods to identify repeat offenders
- Identify fraudulent behavior through machine learning
Account Takeover (ATO)
Account takeover fraud occurs when a legitimate customer account is hijacked by fraudsters who use that account to steal information, make purchases, and more. This can be particularly challenging to detect since the login occurs under a trusted account.
Cybercriminals can target large organizations in ATO attacks in order to authorize bank transfers or steal company secrets. In e-commerce ATOs, attackers steal customer accounts and abuse their saved payment methods, drain rewards points, or max out their BNPL credit.
ATO attacks now lead to more than $16 billion in annual loss just in the U.S., up 300% from 2019. In addition to impacting revenue, compromised accounts quickly erode the trust between the customer and the brand.
Machine learning-based risk decisioning is one of the best ways to prevent an account takeover. By monitoring metrics such as geolocation, session data, and device ID, e-commerce platforms can quickly identify suspicious login attempts and prevent fraud entirely.
What You Can Do:
- Initiate risk-based authentication to protect accounts automatically
- Support multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Watch for logins under new devices and locations that don’t match with the customer’s
- Shut down phishing sites and rogue mobile apps before they steal customer logins
Interception Fraud
Interception fraud occurs when a fraudster uses stolen credit card information to make a purchase and intercepts the package in transit. Fraudsters do this in an attempt to bypass address and location verification during checkout.
In most cases, the criminal will call customer service once the transaction has been approved and change the address to their own. The fraudster may even attempt to steal the package as soon as it’s delivered if the victim is local.
What You Can Do:
- Require additional authentication when making changes to orders or account information
- Train customer service to recognize attempted interception fraud
- Provide shipping and billing notifications to customers via email or text
- Deploy solutions that leverage the EMV® 3-D Secure payment protocol
Buy Now Pay Later Fraud
BNPL fraud is expected to rise throughout 2022 as more retailers offer instant financing options. Attackers exploit BNPL systems by creating fake accounts using synthetic identities, account takeover schemes, and phishing scams.
With an account in place, fraudsters put their products on layaway financing with no intention of paying their balance. They receive the goods and simply create a new account to repeat the process.
What You Can Do:
- leverage BNPL protection to automatically block synthetic identities and apply continuous authentication to safeguard BNPL services
- Review transactions to identify patterns of BNPL fraud in progress (high order values, repeat orders using the same credentials, etc.)
- Look for transactions that don’t match established user behavior
Account Enrollment Fraud
Why take over an account when you can use stolen card information to set up an account or rewards program with an online merchant from scratch using synthetic identity data? Today, Synthetic identity theft is one of the fastest-growing financial crimes in the United States, leading to an estimated $20 billion in losses annually.
In these attacks, fraudsters open an account or activate a mobile app using pilfered card information. Since the new user appears legitimate, there is no discrepancy between shipping addresses or contact information—helping them bypass most traditional fraud detection systems.
What You Can Do:
- Require multiple forms of identity proof and running it through external databases
- Deploy solutions that leverage machine learning and identity science to correlate and verify physical and digital identities
Signs of E-Commerce Fraud
E-commerce fraud isn’t always obvious. There are many patterns and behaviors that can indicate fraud but are difficult to manually detect. This is why machine learning and artificial intelligence are such powerful tools in combating fraud.
Below are a few signs that could indicate e-commerce fraud:
- A new device login for an existing account
- An unusual login location that’s atypical for the user
- Mismatched shipping/billing address
- Large purchases of the same product in a single transaction
- Numerous separate orders placed in quick succession
- Multiple orders to the same address with different cards
- The consumer is using a brand new email address
E-Commerce Fraud Protection Strategies
With the signs of e-commerce fraud covered, let’s explore some e-commerce fraud protection strategies that can protect your businesses as well as your customers.
Conduct Site Security Audits
Cybercriminals can exploit vulnerable websites to steal customer payment information. Conduct regular security checks to ensure your site isn’t compromised or vulnerable to attack. A few things to check include the following:
- Updating or removing outdated plugins
- Removing old user accounts
- Enforcing two-factor authentication for your admin login
- Ensuring SSL and HTTPS is working properly
- Scanning for malware and indicators of compromise
- Backing up configurations and website settings
Maintain PCI Compliance
PCI compliance helps protect customer data by enforcing protections that keep your customers and your business secure. Conduct self-assessments and monitor your compliance to avoid potential fraud and steep fines from noncompliance.
The PCI Security Standards Council has numerous resources you can use to implement better e-commerce fraud protection.
Leverage Data Science and Machine Learning
Card issuers, banks, payment processors and merchants should all deploy tools that enhance features built into the EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS) payment standard to prevent transaction fraud.
Case in point: Outseer 3-D Secure builds upon the 3DS standard by combining it with advanced identity science and shared global intelligence to prevent CNP fraud and protect more than $200 billion in CNP transactions per year.
These same advancements in data science and machine learning also power Outseer Fraud Manager, which analyzes behavior and cross-references it with offline and online digital identities and transaction data to detect fraudulent transactions, logins, and new account enrollments—and prevent e-commerce fraud across any channel.
Avoid Shipping to Nonphysical Addresses
Fraudsters often attempt to use P.O. boxes when committing fraud to avoid compromising their own address. While this isn’t always the case, restricting transactions to P.O. boxes can cut down on the amount of fraudulent transactions processed.
Stopping Fraud, Not Transactions
The flip side of e-commerce fraud prevention is customer experience. At a time when shopping cart abandonment continues to impact 75% of all purchases, adding even the slightest customer friction to prevent fraud is a dicey proposition.
Unlike traditional anti-fraud solutions, Outseer products leverage intelligence from 20 billion annual transactions across 6,000 institutions contributing to our global data network and our identity science expertise to prevent 95% of all fraudulent transactions. This reserves step-up challenges for the scant 5% of transactions that ever require additional scrutiny.

These same advancements in data science and machine learning also power Outseer Fraud Manager, which analyzes behavior and cross-references it with offline and online digital identities and transaction data to detect fraudulent transactions, logins, and new account enrollments—and prevent e-commerce fraud across any channel.
Avoid Shipping to Nonphysical Addresses
Fraudsters often attempt to use P.O. boxes when committing fraud to avoid compromising their own address. While this isn’t always the case, restricting transactions to P.O. boxes can cut down on the amount of fraudulent transactions processed.
Stopping Fraud, Not Transactions
The flip side of e-commerce fraud prevention is customer experience. At a time when shopping cart abandonment continues to impact 75% of all purchases, adding even the slightest customer friction to prevent fraud is a dicey proposition.
Unlike traditional anti-fraud solutions, Outseer products leverage intelligence from 20 billion annual transactions across 6,000 institutions contributing to our global data network and our identity science expertise to prevent 95% of all fraudulent transactions. This reserves step-up challenges for the scant 5% of transactions that ever require additional scrutiny.
By seeing what others can’t, we stop fraud long before an account is created or a fraudulent transaction occurs.

E-Commerce Security: Protect Your Site from Common Threats | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/ecommerce-fraud-security,2022-05-16,"E-Commerce Security: Protect Your Site from Common Threats
Are you concerned about e-commerce security? We explain what e-commerce security is, discuss common threats, and offer solutions.
What Is E-Commerce Security?
E-commerce security is the protection of e-commerce sites from fraudulent activities such as unauthorized access and illicit transactions. Common threats include card-not-present (CNP) fraud, account takeover (ATO) attacks, and more.
As the demand for online and mobile shopping has skyrocketed in recent years, so has the number of attacks on merchant websites. In 2021, an estimated $15.3 billion was lost to card-not-present fraud alone. Not only does this represent direct financial loss for digital channel merchants, but it can also lead to steep fees from fraudulent chargebacks, and do damage to their brand image. Malware attacks that shut down sites for periods of time only add to the problem.
But it’s not all doom and gloom. Below we’ll touch on the most common ecommerce security threats, how they work, and what you can do to prevent them.
E-Commerce Security Threats & Solutions
To better understand ecommerce security, let’s explore how some of the most common e-commerce threats work and the best ways to stop them.
Card Not Present Fraud
Card not present fraud occurs when a person makes an unauthorized purchase using stolen credit card information without physical access to the card. CNP fraud can occur anywhere a merchant cannot inspect the physical card.
Fraudsters typically steal credit card information from phishing scams that trick users into entering their payment information into a cloned version of a trusted site. Once the victim enters their payment details, that information is sent to the fraudsters.
Even when merchants and customers do everything right, they can still fall victim to CNP fraud. Cybercriminals break into legitimate online businesses and steal databases filled with customer payment information. Card details are often sold on dark web marketplaces where other criminals can try and commit fraud with them.
During the first three quarters of 2021, Outseer recovered over 12.9 million unique compromised credit or debit cards from dark web marketplaces and fraud networks. That’s roughly 48,000 compromised cards per day that could otherwise be exploited from criminal gain.
One of the best ways to protect against CNP fraud is to deploy solutions that leverage the EMV® 3-D Secure protocol, which uses shared transaction data and threat intelligence to assign each transaction a risk score. E-commerce sites can choose how they want to handle riskier transactions, with many opting to request additional authentication or blocking blatant fraud altogether.
3DS is one of the most popular forms of e-commerce security thanks to its high accuracy and frictionless flow. By using over 100 data points, 3DS can root out fraudsters without impacting cardholders’ shopping experience.
How to prevent CNP fraud:
- Enforce CVV verification on your website
- Implement solutions that use the 3D-Secure protocol to block fraudulent purchases
- Use an address verification service
Chargeback Fraud
Chargeback fraud occurs when a customer makes a purchase with the sole intention of issuing a chargeback and keeping the item. When a chargeback occurs, the customer is refunded their money and the vendor is charged with a chargeback fee. These fees can vary in size and mount up quickly if chargeback fraud is left unchecked.
Sometimes chargeback fraud can happen accidentally, like when a customer forgets their subscription for autopay and seeks a chargeback. This is known as “friendly fraud.” While friendly fraud may seem innocent enough, it still impacts e-commerce site owners the same way. As it stands now, 44% of merchants report experience return abuseof some kind over the past 12 months, and 66% say it has been getting worse.
How to prevent chargeback fraud:
- Implement solutions that use the 3D-Secure protocol to block fraudulent chargebacks
- Send email confirmations when a product has been purchased
- Have a clear and visible return policy
- Use detailed product descriptions and payment descriptors
- Use shipping insurance or shipping confirmations when possible
- Make issuing a refund through your site simple, vs. going through the card company
Account Takeover
Account takeover occurs when a legitimate customer account is hijacked by fraudsters who use that account to steal information and make fraudulent transactions. This can be particularly challenging to detect since the login occurs under a trusted account.
Cybercriminals can target large organizations to authorize bank transfers or steal company secrets. For eCommerce sites, attackers steal customer accounts and abuse their saved payment methods or max out their BNPL credit.
Luckily, by comparing known user behavior with new login attempts, artificial intelligence can use risk scoring to block sign-ins that are highly suspicious.
How to prevent ATO attacks:
- Implement frictionless, risk-based authentication to protect accounts automatically, even if the username and password are stolen.
- Use multi-factor authentication when possible.
- Watch out for logins under new devices and locations that don’t match typical user behavior.
Account Enrollment Fraud
Why take over an account when you can use stolen card information to set up an account or rewards program with an online merchant from scratch using a synthetic identity? According to the FBI, synthetic identity fraud is a $6 billion problem that the FBI calls one of the fastest-growing forms of financial crime. Synthetic identities can be tough to root out because they use a mix of fraudulent and randomly generated information. Once a synthetic identity is used, attackers can simply create another account and repeat the process.
In these attacks, fraudsters open an account or activate a mobile app using pilfered card information. Since the new user appears legitimate, there is no discrepancy between shipping addresses or contact information—helping them bypass most traditional fraud detection systems.
How to prevent Account Enrollment Fraud:
- Require multiple forms of identity proof and running it through external databases
- Deploy solutions that leverage machine learning and identity science to correlate and verify physical and digital identities
Bot Attacks
Attackers can use automated bots to test stolen credit card details, knock sites offline, brute-force admin passwords, and scalp in-demand items to turn a profit on your customers. Bot attacks pose a significant e-commerce security threat because of the scale and speed in which they operate.
The best way to prevent bot attacks is to use machine learning fraud prevention. Machine learning studies the behavior of legitimate customers as well as bots to detect and defend your e-commerce site from attacks accurately.
Unlike CAPTCHA checks, frictionless fraud detection only stops bots and doesn’t slow down your real customers. This helps e-commerce businesses improve their customer experience, reduce their cart abandonment, and grow their revenue.
How to prevent bot attacks:
- Use frictionless fraud prevention to stop bots, automated attacks, and fraudsters
- Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication to stop brute-force attacks
- Block free or commonly abused proxy and VPN services
- Monitor for spikes in failed credit card or gift card transactions
Buy Now, Pay Later Fraud
Buy now, pay later services offer customers zero-interest credit to buy anything from clothes to computers. BNPL services are popular among e-commerce sites since they increase the average order value and allow customers to spend more without paying the full balance upfront.
Criminals have grown wise to BNPL services and targeted these lines of credit as low-hanging fruit for their fraudulent endeavors. Fraudsters commonly commandeer customer accounts and drain their BNPL credit, or use synthetic IDs to create a bogus account with the e-commerce site.
The best way to protect your BNPL service is by using risk-based authentication throughout the shopping and enrollment process. Today’s most robust platforms protect your customers by protecting against loss by detecting hijacked accounts and preventing synthetic identities from BNPL enrollment.
How to prevent buy now, pay later fraud:
- Use BNPL authentication to prevent account takeovers and synthetic identity attacks
- Ensure your BNPL platform uses machine learning to detect evolving threats
- Only use a trusted BNPL partner
Brand Abuse
Brand abuse continues to rise each year and is currently the most popular tactic for online fraudsters. Brand abusers steal branded assets and impersonate e-commerce sites through phishing campaigns in order to trick victims into sending their payment details and making fraudulent purchases.
These attacks not only defraud your customers but erode your brand image with each attack. Many customers hold the brand responsible for the attack even though they weren’t involved. Brand abuse can occur through fake websites, rogue mobile apps, and fraudulent social media accounts.
The best way to prevent brand abuse is to source a cyberattack takedown service that continuously monitors the Internet, app stores, and social media to shut down sites, apps, and accounts before they can do serious financial and reputational harm.
How to prevent brand abuse:
- Use a 24/7 takedown service to prevent attacks
- Register or monitor similar domain names to prevent attackers from using them
- Use anti-phishing services internally to protect your staff
- Educate your customers on brand abuse
Malware Attacks
Malware can knock e-commerce sites offline, flood them with spam, and even redirect customers to malicious checkout pages. Malware typically infects websites that have outdated plugins or vulnerabilities on their hosting web server. Common or default passwords also make it easy for attackers to plant malware on e-commerce sites.
The best thing you can do to prevent malware is to keep your plugins up to date, secure your accounts with two-factor authentication, and hire a webmaster to manage the security of your website.
How to prevent e-commerce malware attacks:
- Implement risk-based authentication to authentication for admin logins
- Minimize the number of plugins used and keep them up to date
- Use SSL and HTTPS to secure communications
- Install a web application firewall
- Hire a system administrator or web developer to keep up on security
E-commerce Security Best Practices
With some of the most common e-commerce threats covered, let’s explore some general best practices you can use to protect your customers, brand, and revenue.
Follow and Monitor Compliance Requirements
e-commerce sites must follow various regulations to keep their site operational and their customers protected. Familiarize yourself with standards such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, and CCPA. These regulations are designed to protect customer data and preserve their privacy. Site owners can use numerous compliance auditing tools to monitor their status and identify areas to be corrected.
Use Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to Stay Ahead of Threats
Machine learning and artificial intelligence improve e-commerce security by learning the patterns and behaviors of different threats. By understanding the threat behavior and trends, e-commerce sites can stay protected against attackers—even when they change their tactics.
Your best bets will be products that leverage machine learning combined with data science informed by large-scale shared identity and transaction intelligence to provide seamless fraud prevention across all digital channels.
Conduct an E-Commerce Security Audit
Your e-commerce site can have various points of entry for attackers from vulnerable hosting providers to misconfigured plugins. Consider conducting quarterly site audits with a web vulnerability scanner and having a professional work with you during remediation.
Audits can take some time, depending on your e-commerce site’s size and complexity. Security audits typically highlight vulnerable plugins, misconfigurations, and accounts with weak passwords.
Many auditing tools follow a series of best practices allowing you to rest easy knowing your site is secure. If you’re a larger e-commerce brand, consider using a web access firewall and hiring remediation experts to fix critical vulnerabilities as they’re discovered.

The timeless tradition of coins and piggy banks in Japan is witnessing a seismic shift. The country’s long-standing love affair with coins is giving way to a cashless revolution, driven by a confluence of factors including technological advancements, shifting attitudes towards savings, and even the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. As the nation transitions to a cashless society, the role of platforms like PayPay and Line Pay security solutions such as Outseer’s 3-D Secure and Fraud Manager ensuring the safety and convenience of this new financial landscape.
Coins No More: The Rise of Cashless Transactions
The once-steady stockpile of coins in Japan has dwindled remarkably in recent times. This decline, fuelled by the popularity of cashless payment methods, reflects a changing mindset among the Japanese population. Factors such as Covid-related concerns over handling physical currency and the convenience of cashless options have propelled the adoption of digital transactions.
Cashless transactions accounted for a notable 36% of all consumer payments in 2022, a significant leap from the 15% reported a decade earlier. This trend signals a transformative shift in Japanese spending habits and, importantly, how financial interactions occur.
PayPay and Line Pay: Leaders in the Cashless Revolution
Among the array of cashless payment options in Japan, PayPay and Line Pay stands as prominent players. Leveraging the widespread usage of the Line messaging app, Line Pay allows users to make transactions at various merchants, send money to friends, and even receive Line points with every payment. The app’s convenience, coupled with its integration into the daily lives of users, contributes to the steady adoption of cashless transactions.
Launched as a joint venture between SoftBank and Yahoo Japan Corporation in 2018, PayPay rapidly gained traction by offering enticing discounts and cashback incentives to users. This strategic approach fueled its rapid adoption and established PayPay as a formidable player in the cashless revolution.
Similar to Line Pay, PayPay also integrates seamlessly into the daily routines of users. The service enables individuals to make purchases at a wide range of merchants, from convenience stores to restaurants, using their smartphones. By scanning QR codes displayed at the point of sale, users can complete transactions swiftly and securely. Additionally, PayPay collaborates with various businesses to provide limited-time promotions and special offers, further encouraging users to embrace cashless payments.
One of the standout features of PayPay is its commitment to promoting financial inclusion. Recognizing that not everyone in Japan has access to traditional banking services, PayPay aims to bridge this gap by providing a convenient and accessible payment solution for all. This initiative has contributed to its popularity across different demographics, making it a widely accepted and recognized method of payment.
Japan’s journey towards a cashless society has been significantly accelerated. With the combined efforts of these two industry leaders, cashless transactions are becoming increasingly ingrained in the everyday lives of Japanese citizens, marking a transformative shift in the way financial transactions are conducted.

Empowering the Elderly: A Proactive and Responsive Approach to Safeguarding Against Financial Fraud in Japan | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/empowering-the-elderly-a-proactive-and-responsive-approach-to-safeguarding-against-financial-fraud-in-japan,2023-10-05,"Empowering the Elderly: A Proactive and Responsive Approach to Safeguarding Against Financial Fraud in Japan
The rising wave of financial fraud and scams in Japan is a pressing concern, with devastating consequences for individuals and the financial system at large. As authorities grapple with finding effective solutions, a proactive and responsive approach that combines advanced technology and education offers a more comprehensive defence strategy than simply demonetising the elderly population. Let’s delve into why this approach is essential and how it can empower individuals while preserving their financial well-being.
Understanding the Vulnerability of the Elderly
Elderly individuals are indeed more susceptible to financial fraud due to a variety of factors, including unfamiliarity with digital platforms, cognitive decline, and a generally trusting nature. Recognising this vulnerability, Japan’s National Police Agency’s call for measures to protect the elderly is commendable. However, stripping them of their access to cash machines, while well-intentioned, presents limitations and implications that might not effectively address the root of the problem.
The Limitations of Demonetisation
While removing bank cards from the elderly might prevent them from falling victim to certain types of scams, it poses practical challenges and potential drawbacks:
- Loss of Financial Independence: Restricting access to cash machines could hinder the elderly’s ability to manage their finances independently, potentially leading to inconvenience and dependency on others.
- Incomplete Protection: transactions, most scams actually rely on digital transactions. Cybercrimes such as phishing, identity theft, and online fraud would still pose a threat to elderly individuals’ financial security.
- Reduced Quality of Life: Access to cash is crucial for daily transactions. Limiting this access might negatively impact the quality of life for the elderly, who rely on cash for their day-to-day needs.
The Proactive and Responsive Approach: Education and Technology
Rather than solely relying on measures like demonetisation, a proactive and responsive approach offers a more effective and sustainable solution:
- Education: Empowering the elderly with knowledge about different types of scams, their tactics, and how to recognise and respond to them is paramount. Educational campaigns can equip them with the tools to identify suspicious activities and protect themselves proactively.
- Technology Solutions: Advanced and proven technology, such as those provided by Outseer’s Fraud Manager and 3-D Secure, can complement education efforts. These solutions offer real-time fraud detection, two-factor authentication, and behavioural analytics, making it significantly harder for criminals to exploit the elderly’s lack of familiarity with digital platforms.
Benefits of a Proactive and Responsive Approach
- Empowerment: Education empowers the elderly to make informed decisions, reducing their susceptibility to scams across various channels.
- Comprehensive Protection: Technology solutions work hand in hand with education, providing a multi-layered defence against both traditional and modern fraud tactics.
- Preservation of Dignity: The proactive and responsive approach preserves the elderly’s dignity by not limiting their financial independence, allowing them to continue managing their finances with confidence.
Building Resilience Through Education and Technology
While the intent behind demonetisation is laudable, a proactive and responsive approach that combines education and advanced technology offers a more effective and empowering strategy. By equipping the elderly with knowledge and tools to detect and prevent scams, we can foster resilience against evolving fraud tactics. Let us advocate for an approach that not only safeguards the elderly but also celebrates their financial autonomy and independence, ensuring a secure digital landscape for all generations.

A Complete Guide to Accepting EMV Payments | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/emv-payments,2021-10-28,"A Complete Guide to Accepting EMV Payments
Wondering about EMV Payments? We explain what EMV cards are, how they work, and how they help reduce fraudulent activity.
What Are EMV Payments?
EMV® is a security standard used worldwide for both contact and contactless payments done with credit, debit, and prepaid cards that leverage a smart chip. EMV payments are now central to protecting consumers and businesses from fraudulent transactions.
EMV is short for Europay, MasterCard, and Visa, the companies that originally created the standard. Today, there are nearly 11 billion EMV cards in use worldwide.
How Does EMV Chip Technology Work?
Customers either insert their card into a payment terminal that reads the EMV chip, or hold their card close to a contactless card reader. (When an EMV chip is installed in a non-card form factor such as a mobile phone or smartwatch, contactless EMV payment is the only option.)
Embedded within the chip is an encrypted digital signature that the card reader uses to validate the transaction and ensure the card is legitimate. All EMV cards are required to use a form of encryption to prevent card spoofing and data theft. Card issuers can choose from three different authentication methods to enable EMV on their cards. No matter what authentication is used, merchants only need a single EMV-capable terminal to accept EMV payments.
EMV payment technology uses the internet to communicate, but can still process transactions offline. Of the three authentication methods, Dynamic Data Authentication (DDA) and Static Data Authentication (SDA) can work offline. Since both the card and the card reader are preprogrammed with cryptographic keys, validation doesn’t require a network connection.
How Are EMV Payments More Secure?
While no fraud protection is 100% bulletproof, EMV payments are significantly more secure than magnetic strip (magstripe) transactions. In the past, criminals would steal the information stored magnetically on credit cards and write that information to their own fake card for spending. EMV payment methods prevent this by using cryptography to make cards nearly impossible to clone.
Are Merchants Legally Required to Accept EMV payments?
The short answer is no. There are no legal requirements that enforce EMV payments. However, using outdated magstripe technology dramatically increases the risk of accepting fraudulent payments, placing liability for those transactions on the merchant.
As of October 1, 2015, merchants that only accept magstripe payments are held liable for fraudulent transactions occurring on EMV cards. Effective April 16, 2021, this liability shift was extended to automated fuel dispensers (gas pumps). As technology advances, liability shift occurs to protect card issuers and incentivize merchants to use more secure technology. And it’s working: Today, more than 88% of all card-present transactions worldwide use EMV chip technology.
Will EMV Make Merchants PCI Compliant?
Simply installing an EMV terminal will not make a merchant Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant. Achieving PCI compliance requires meeting numerous standards and completing either a self-assessment or receiving an official audit from a security assessor.
EMV chips only work for card-present transactions, meaning any business that does e-commerce or accepts card information over the phone will need additional security measures to meet PCI standards. Even with EMV, card data such as primary account numbers (PANs) can be exposed on your POS terminal. Adding additional layers of security such as encryption, antivirus, and individual login accounts can help merchants achieve compliance.
What Do Merchants Need to Accept EMV Payments?
In order to accept EMV payments, merchants need an EMV-enabled credit card reader. Rather than swiping the magnetic strip, customers will insert their card vertically so the terminal can read their EMV chip.
As mentioned some EMV-capable terminals also support contactless payments using Near Field Communications (NFC) technology. If you’ve ever seen anyone pay by waving their phone or smartwatch during checkout, that’s NFC at work. If you’re looking to accept both NFC and EMV payments, ensure your reader can support both methods.
EMV readers can vary in pricing depending on their model and capabilities. Prices range from $50 for small mobile readers to $1000 for larger terminals you see in retail stores.
Is There an EMV Equivalent for Online Payments?
Yes. Over the years, EMV specifications have evolved beyond the original EMV chip standard to cover a wide range of technologies that support card-based payments. With the rapid rise in the volume and value of e-commerce payments, these new specifications have come to include EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS), a global standard for authenticating card-not-present (CNP) transactions made via mobile and online browsers, apps, digital wallets, and more.
Use of 3DS 2.2, the latest iteration of the protocol, has grown 79% over the past 18 months, fueled in part by the massive shift in consumer digital adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic and attendant increases in CNP fraud, which topped $6.4 billion in 2020.
Anti-fraud solutions built upon the features in 3DS analyze hundreds of different risk indicators and share that data with the acquiring and issuing bank. Armed with this data, the issuer’s 3DS providers can assess the risk associated with the transaction.
This process allows legitimate customers to continue uninterrupted, while highly suspicious transactions are directed through a challenge flow. Challenge flows typically require authentication through text or email verification but can also include biometric data and one-time passwords.
But the innovation doesn’t have to stop with the EMV payments specifications themselves.

A Complete Guide to Accepting EMV Payments
Wondering about EMV Payments? We explain what EMV cards are, how they work, and how they help reduce fraudulent activity.
What Are EMV Payments?
EMV® is a security standard used worldwide for both contact and contactless payments done with credit, debit, and prepaid cards that leverage a smart chip. EMV payments are now central to protecting consumers and businesses from fraudulent transactions.
EMV is short for Europay, MasterCard, and Visa, the companies that originally created the standard. Today, there are nearly 11 billion EMV cards in use worldwide.
How Does EMV Chip Technology Work?
Customers either insert their card into a payment terminal that reads the EMV chip, or hold their card close to a contactless card reader. (When an EMV chip is installed in a non-card form factor such as a mobile phone or smartwatch, contactless EMV payment is the only option.)
Embedded within the chip is an encrypted digital signature that the card reader uses to validate the transaction and ensure the card is legitimate. All EMV cards are required to use a form of encryption to prevent card spoofing and data theft. Card issuers can choose from three different authentication methods to enable EMV on their cards. No matter what authentication is used, merchants only need a single EMV-capable terminal to accept EMV payments.
EMV payment technology uses the internet to communicate, but can still process transactions offline. Of the three authentication methods, Dynamic Data Authentication (DDA) and Static Data Authentication (SDA) can work offline. Since both the card and the card reader are preprogrammed with cryptographic keys, validation doesn’t require a network connection.
How Are EMV Payments More Secure?
While no fraud protection is 100% bulletproof, EMV payments are significantly more secure than magnetic strip (magstripe) transactions. In the past, criminals would steal the information stored magnetically on credit cards and write that information to their own fake card for spending. EMV payment methods prevent this by using cryptography to make cards nearly impossible to clone.
Are Merchants Legally Required to Accept EMV payments?
The short answer is no. There are no legal requirements that enforce EMV payments. However, using outdated magstripe technology dramatically increases the risk of accepting fraudulent payments, placing liability for those transactions on the merchant.
As of October 1, 2015, merchants that only accept magstripe payments are held liable for fraudulent transactions occurring on EMV cards. Effective April 16, 2021, this liability shift was extended to automated fuel dispensers (gas pumps). As technology advances, liability shift occurs to protect card issuers and incentivize merchants to use more secure technology. And it’s working: Today, more than 88% of all card-present transactions worldwide use EMV chip technology.
Will EMV Make Merchants PCI Compliant?
Simply installing an EMV terminal will not make a merchant Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant. Achieving PCI compliance requires meeting numerous standards and completing either a self-assessment or receiving an official audit from a security assessor.
EMV chips only work for card-present transactions, meaning any business that does e-commerce or accepts card information over the phone will need additional security measures to meet PCI standards. Even with EMV, card data such as primary account numbers (PANs) can be exposed on your POS terminal. Adding additional layers of security such as encryption, antivirus, and individual login accounts can help merchants achieve compliance.
What Do Merchants Need to Accept EMV Payments?
In order to accept EMV payments, merchants need an EMV-enabled credit card reader. Rather than swiping the magnetic strip, customers will insert their card vertically so the terminal can read their EMV chip.
As mentioned some EMV-capable terminals also support contactless payments using Near Field Communications (NFC) technology. If you’ve ever seen anyone pay by waving their phone or smartwatch during checkout, that’s NFC at work. If you’re looking to accept both NFC and EMV payments, ensure your reader can support both methods.
EMV readers can vary in pricing depending on their model and capabilities. Prices range from $50 for small mobile readers to $1000 for larger terminals you see in retail stores.
Is There an EMV Equivalent for Online Payments?
Yes. Over the years, EMV specifications have evolved beyond the original EMV chip standard to cover a wide range of technologies that support card-based payments. With the rapid rise in the volume and value of e-commerce payments, these new specifications have come to include EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS), a global standard for authenticating card-not-present (CNP) transactions made via mobile and online browsers, apps, digital wallets, and more.

The adoption of faster payment systems has revolutionised transaction processes in countries such as India, the UK, Malaysia, and Australia. These systems offer unparalleled convenience and speed, but they also bring about a new challenge: fraud. As the popularity of faster payment systems grows, fraudsters have swiftly adapted their tactics to exploit vulnerabilities within these systems. This poses significant challenges for both financial institutions and regulators.
A report commissioned by Outseer shed light on the trends associated with different forms of payment fraud attacks. According to the report, 57% of surveyed financial institutions noted an increase in mule activity over real-time payment rails in 2022 compared to 2021. Furthermore, 71% reported an increase in consumer Account Takeover (ATO) using real-time payment rails, while 62% observed a rise in consumer authorised push payment (APP) fraud via real-time payment rails.
These alarming statistics highlight the urgent need for robust measures to mitigate fraud risks within the context of faster payment systems. Financial institutions and regulators in India, the UK, Malaysia, and Australia are actively addressing this issue through the implementation of various strategies and safeguards.
In this blog, we will explore the faster payment systems in India, the UK, Malaysia, and Australia, and delve into how regulators are supporting and protecting customers in these countries. We will examine the key features and advancements of these payment systems that have transformed the way transactions are conducted. Additionally, we will delve into the regulatory frameworks and measures implemented to ensure customer protection, enhance security, and mitigate fraud risks. By understanding the evolving landscape of faster payment systems and the regulatory efforts in place, we can gain insights into the initiatives taken to foster a safe and efficient environment for customers globally.
Rapid Adoption and Fraud Challenges
Faster payment systems, such as Brazil’s Pix, India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Australia’s New Payments Platform (NPP), Malaysia’s DuitNow, and UK’s Faster Payments Service have experienced remarkable growth, surpassing traditional payment methods. Unfortunately, fraudsters have wasted no time in capitalising on these systems. They employ various techniques, including social engineering, to deceive unsuspecting consumers into voluntarily sending funds to them. This rise in fraud attacks, particularly mule activity and consumer-authorised push payment (APP) fraud, has compelled financial institutions and regulators to be on high alert.
Faster payment systems in India, the UK, Malaysia, and Australia and The Growing Menace of APP Scams
India: Unified Payments Interface (UPI)
India’s UPI has witnessed tremendous growth, driven by central bank incentives and the efforts of telecom companies to promote digital payment adoption. With its user-friendly interface and seamless transaction experience, UPI has become the preferred choice for person-to-person and person-to-merchant payments. However, the rapid adoption of UPI has also attracted the attention of fraudsters. They exploit the trust and convenience associated with UPI to carry out scams such as fake payment requests, phishing attacks, and fraudulent merchant transactions. Financial institutions and regulators in India are actively working to enhance security measures and educate users about potential risks.
Security improvements in the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system include:
- Two-Factor Authentication: To enhance security, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has mandated the implementation of two-factor authentication for UPI transactions. This ensures that users have to provide additional verification, such as a PIN or biometric authentication, to authorise transactions, making it harder for fraudsters to gain unauthorised access.
- Transaction Limits: The NPCI has set transaction limits for UPI payments, both per transaction and per day, to minimise the impact of potential fraud. By imposing limits, the system reduces the risk of significant financial losses in case of fraudulent transactions.
- Strong Customer Authentication (SCA): The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has introduced SCA guidelines, requiring banks and payment service providers to implement strong customer authentication methods. SCA involves multiple layers of authentication, such as one-time passwords (OTP), biometrics, or device recognition, to ensure the legitimacy of transactions and protect users from unauthorised access.
UK: Faster Payments Service (FPS)
The UK’s Faster Payments Service (FPS) has transformed the payments landscape, enabling near-instantaneous transfers between individuals and businesses. While the introduction of FPS has provided convenience and efficiency, it has also opened new avenues for fraud. Fraudsters take advantage of the speed and irreversibility of FPS transactions to trick victims into authorising payments to fraudulent accounts. Common scams include invoice redirection fraud, romance scams, and investment fraud. UK financial institutions and regulatory bodies have implemented measures to combat fraud, including secure authentication protocols, fraud detection systems, and public awareness campaigns.
UK regulators have been actively addressing the issue of APP fraud by implementing various measures. The introduction of the voluntary Contingent Reimbursement Model (the code) aimed to reimburse victims of scams. However, recent developments indicate a shift towards mandatory reimbursement legislation, holding institutions accountable for combating fraud.
PSR (Payment Systems Regulator) has recently outlined new regulations for the UK’s Faster Payments scheme. Under these rules, participants in the scheme will be required to share the cost of reimbursing victims of authorised push payment (APP) fraud; this will come into force in 2024. Alongside reimbursement, the regulator is increasing transparency through the publication of data on how well firms are protecting customers from fraud, promoting intelligence-sharing to spot and prevent fraudulent transactions, and expanding the roll-out of the name-checking service Confirmation of Payee.
Malaysia: DuitNow
DuitNow is the faster payment system in Malaysia that enables instant fund transfers between participating banks and e-wallets. It was introduced by Payments Network Malaysia Sdn Bhd (PayNet), the national payment network and shared central infrastructure provider in Malaysia. DuitNow aims to provide a convenient, secure, and efficient way to transfer money in real time.
The increased adoption of DuitNow in Malaysia has unfortunately coincided with an increase in authorized push payment (APP) fraud, particularly through the notorious Macau scam. However, DuitNow has implemented several aspects to provide a safer environment for users, mitigating the risks associated with such fraudulent activities.
Here are some key aspects of DuitNow that enhance customer protection:
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Many participating banks and e-wallet providers have implemented two-factor authentication as an additional layer of security. This requires users to provide a second form of verification, such as a One-Time Password (OTP) or biometric authentication, to authorise transactions. 2FA adds an extra level of protection against unauthorised access to user accounts.
- Transaction Limits: Participating banks and e-wallet providers have set transaction limits to mitigate the impact of potential fraud. These limits restrict the maximum amount that can be transferred or paid through DuitNow. By imposing transaction limits, the risk of large-scale fraudulent transactions is reduced, providing better protection to customers.
- Customer Education and Awareness: Financial institutions and regulatory bodies have been actively educating customers about safe banking practices and raising awareness about common fraud techniques. Through various channels such as websites, mobile apps, and customer support, users are provided with guidance on how to protect themselves from fraud, including tips on securing personal information and recognising phishing attempts.
- Enhanced Fraud Detection and Investigation: Collaborative efforts between financial institutions, law enforcement agencies, and regulatory bodies have been strengthened to combat fraud more effectively. Sharing of information and intelligence helps identify trends, track down fraudsters, and facilitate investigations. This proactive approach enables quicker response times and the potential recovery of funds in cases of fraud.
- Regular System Upgrades and Security Audits: PayNet, the entity responsible for DuitNow, regularly performs system upgrades and security audits to identify vulnerabilities and address any potential weaknesses. This ensures that the infrastructure supporting DuitNow remains robust and up-to-date in the face of evolving fraud techniques.
- Continuous Improvement: PayNet, financial institutions, and other stakeholders involved in the DuitNow ecosystem are committed to continuous improvement. They actively seek feedback from users and monitor industry best practices to refine the system’s security measures. This ongoing commitment to improvement is crucial in staying ahead of fraudsters and maintaining customer trust.
Australia: New Payments Platform (NPP)
Australia’s New Payments Platform (NPP) has revolutionised the way Australians make payments, offering real-time transfers and the convenience of using mobile phone numbers or email addresses as payment identifiers. The adoption of NPP has gained significant momentum, with more financial institutions and businesses joining the platform. However, this increased usage has also attracted the attention of fraudsters. Scams targeting NPP users include impersonation scams, where fraudsters pose as legitimate recipients of funds and requests for payment under false pretenses. Financial institutions and regulators in Australia are collaborating to enhance security measures and promote consumer education to mitigate the risks associated with NPP transactions.
One effective tool within the NPP system is PayID, an addressing service that allows users to link their phone numbers or email addresses to their accounts for seamless real-time payments. Research commissioned by NPP Australia reveals that one in four PayID users have successfully prevented mistaken payments by editing or halting transactions, showcasing the significant role PayID plays in combating fraud and safeguarding users’ funds. PayID simplifies payments by replacing the need for complex BSB and account numbers, and transactions can be conveniently conducted through a bank’s internet or mobile banking app. Additionally, PayID enhances security by displaying the recipient’s name before finalizing a payment, reducing the risk of falling victim to fraudulent transactions.
To further bolster security, regulatory bodies such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) oversee payment systems and financial transactions in Australia. These entities actively work to enhance regulations and legislation related to scams targeting the NPP. This includes strengthening consumer protection laws and imposing stricter obligations on financial institutions to prevent fraud, for example:
- Industry Codes of Practice: In collaboration with industry stakeholders, the Australian Payments Network (AusPayNet) has developed the ePayments Code. This code sets out best practices and standards for electronic payments, including addressing liability and reimbursement for victims of APP scams. It provides a framework for financial institutions to follow and promotes transparency, fairness, and accountability in the payments ecosystem.
- Reporting and Data Sharing: The government encourages financial institutions to report instances of APP scams and share information on fraudulent activities with regulatory authorities. This facilitates the identification of emerging trends, the implementation of proactive measures, and the development of effective strategies to combat scams.
- Collaboration and Coordination: Government agencies, including ASIC and AUSTRAC, collaborate with industry participants, law enforcement agencies, and consumer advocacy groups to coordinate efforts in combating APP scams. This collaboration ensures a comprehensive approach to addressing fraud, sharing intelligence, and raising awareness among the public.
- Reimbursement Framework: The government is actively working on a reimbursement framework for victims of APP scams. The objective is to establish clear guidelines and standards for financial institutions to provide timely and fair reimbursement to customers who have fallen victim to fraudulent transactions. This reimbursement framework aims to strike a balance between protecting consumers and ensuring the accountability of financial institutions.
A proactive stance and the adoption of a multi-layered approach are needed
As faster payment systems continue to gain popularity worldwide, the fight against fraud becomes an ongoing challenge. Financial institutions, regulators, and users must collaborate to implement robust security measures, remain vigilant against emerging scams, and continually educate themselves about fraud risks. By staying proactive and adopting a multi-layered approach to fraud prevention, countries like India, the UK, and Australia can ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of their faster payment ecosystems, protecting consumers from falling victim to scams.",,"account takeover, fraud, investment fraud, payment fraud, phishing, scam, social engineering",7,2023-06-05,"Faster Payments, Faster Fraud: Examining the Challenges of Faster Payment Systems’ Mass Adoption in India, the UK, Malaysia, and Australia | Outseer.

"FBI 2024 Fraud Statistics: UP, UP, and AWAY! | Outseer",https://www.outseer.com/blog/fbi-2024-fraud-statistics,2025-04-30,"FBI 2024 Fraud Statistics: UP, UP, and AWAY!
In April 2025, the FBI released its annual Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) fraud report. To no one’s surprise, the losses in 2024 grew. It is at $16.6 billion, up 33% from 2023. For the past five years, IC3 has reported $50.5 billion in cumulative losses. And that total is just for crimes reported by consumers and businesses.
What is most interesting is how cleanly the IC3 breaks out the fraud data for analysis. So, let’s unpack this report. Chart 1 contains the crime type categories by dollars lost.
Chart 1: Crime Type Categories by Dollars Lost
Investment scams, at $6.6 billion have shot to the top, almost doubled since 2022. Business Email Compromises (BEC) have leveled off for the past three years at $2.8 billion, but still high given this fraud category began around 2011. Companies just don’t learn.
Tech Support scams are up $500 million since 2023 to $1.464 billion and have risen almost 87% since 2022.
Confidence Fraud/Romance is up slightly since 2023 but down 9% since 2022. This is probably down, with the big increase in pig butchering (a combination of romance and investment) probably included under investment fraud.
A few other interesting loss numbers:
- Cryptocurrency was involved in $9.3 billion of the $16.6 billion total losses (56%). This was mainly in BEC and investment scams and some Confidence/Romance and Tech Support scams. In 2023, cryptocurrency was involved in 3.8 billion. So, there has been a 250% increase in the use of cryptocurrency in 2024.
- 60+ (elderly) fraud losses were $4.8 billion (more on this later)
- Gold courier scams had $219 million in losses. This is where scammers use couriers to pick up cash and gold from customers under one of many ruses. This is happening across the country. Here is a story in April 2025. “Two men were arrested for their involvement in ‘courier scams’ in Maryland, resulting in victims losing over $700,000.” In San Diego, CA, police have arrested many couriers for picking up gold and cash from victims, according to the San Diego District Attorney’s office.
- Call center scams were up to $1.9 billion in losses. This was mainly in tech support and cryptocurrency exchange situations.
- Average loss was $19,372.
Every age group is getting scammed. This is consistent with some recent information I received from a US bank which confirmed that all age segments are successfully being attacked by the scammers. The additional point they made was the vast majority of the losses were suffered by the elderly.
Chart 2 shows the numbers of scams and dollar losses by age group. You can see in the chart the number of reported incidents was fairly evenly spilt between the age groups. The last three age groups suffer the most because that is where more wealth has been built up.
Chart 2: Numbers of Scams and Dollar Losses
This year the FBI IC3 report has a special section on elderly fraud losses. It is important that the report has a special section on elderly fraud losses, as the losses per incident are much higher for the elderly and they have no time or ability to recoup these losses. These losses can be financially and emotionally devastating. The key elderly loss statistics are in Chart 3.
Chart 3: Key Elderly Statistics
The elderly lost $4.9 billion in 2023. The average reported loss for the elderly is now $83,000. These may be the most important statistics in this report. And 7500 complainants lost over $100,000. Also, there was a 43% increase in losses from 2023 for the elderly. This is a very disturbing trend.
In another section of the report, there is more breakdown of top elderly dollar losses by crime types: Investment losses for elderly were $1.8 billion, Tech Support was $900 million, Confidence/Romance was almost $400 million and government impersonation over $200 million. Cryptocurrency was involved in $2.8 billion of the fraud (58%).
It is exciting to see the newly established National Elder Fraud Coordination Center (NEFCC) open this month, just as the IC3 report was released. One of the primary goals of the NEFCC is to bring the criminals who attack the elderly to justice. Watch for important results as this year unfolds.
When the fraudsters commit the fraud/scams, there are several key ways the money moves. Chart 4 shows this.
Chart 4: Top Ways Funds Are Lost in Fraud
Notice how cryptocurrency and wire transfers lead the money outflow, with cryptocurrency the number one way. Some states are now limiting the daily crypto ATM deposit limit to $1000. This daily limit should be law in every state. Also, these statistics put financial institutions on call to add strong controls to prevent money mules. This includes strengthening account opening controls and having inbound transaction monitoring.
The report also breaks out losses by state. Chart 5 shows the top states by complaints and number of losses.
Chart 5: Top States by Complaints and Number of Losses
With the slow death of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), I think these state fraud loss numbers could become the catalyst for states to take action to require scam prevention from banks, telcos and digital platforms to help protect their constituents. Certainly, California and New York, two states with strong legislatures and existing strong consumer laws, could step up to help protect their constituents. In fact, in March, the California Senate held a hearing on Consumer Scams.
The 2024 Report also included several techniques the FBI deploys to recover losses and to prevent losses. The first technique is the Financial Fraud Kill Chain. According to the report: “the IC3 Recovery Asset Team streamlines communications with financial institutions and FBI field offices to assist in the freezing of funds for victims of fraudulent domestic and international transactions via the Financial Fraud Kill Chain. Most Financial Fraud Kill Chain incidents initiated by the IC3 RAT are Business Email Compromise (BEC). The Financial Fraud Kill Chain can also be initiated for Tech Support Fraud, Romance Scams, and Data Breaches.” Chart 6 show a five-year history of the Financial Fraud Kill Chain
Chart 6: Financial Fraud Kill Chain (5 Years)
The second technique is Operation Level Up. The report says: “Launched in January 2024, Operation Level identified victims of cryptocurrency investment fraud and notified them of the scam. Operation Level Up notifies victims while the scam is in process. The operation was initiated with the support of agents from FBI and the U.S. Secret Service.” This primarily has involved crypto currency investment frauds, known as pig butchering. Below are the results:
Success Stories
Utilizing IC3 complaint data, Operation Level Up reported:
- 4,323 victims of cryptocurrency investment fraud were notified.
- 76% of those victims were unaware they were being scammed.
- Estimated savings to victims of $285,639,989.
- 42 victims referred to an FBI victim specialist for suicide intervention.
The third technique involved shutting down scam call centers. The report went on to say: “Since 2022, the DOJ, FBI, and IC3 have collaborated with law enforcement in India, such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in New Delhi and local Indian states, to combat cyber-enabled financial crimes and transnational call center fraud.” The success of this technique is shown below:
Success Stories
- FBI responded to over 38 requests from law enforcement in India and provided approximately 60 actionable leads.
- FBI enabled over 215 arrests through 11 joint operations with the CBI and other local law enforcement in 2024. This represented a 700% increase in arrests from 2023, the first full year of the collaboration.
- FBI conducted hundreds of interviews and continues to support Indian law enforcement efforts and prosecution of call centers perpetrating these frauds.
Unfortunately, many of the very large scam call center/compounds are in lawless Myanmar and will be difficult to shut down. China has had limited success shutting down some scam compounds in Myanmar. Other scam compounds are located in Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines, parts of the Middle East and Latin America.
Conclusion
The FBI IC3 2024 Internet Crime Report echoes what we saw in the recent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 2024 Sentinel Report. Both reports showed about a 25–33% increase in fraud from 2023. The dollar range between the two reports is $12.5–$16.6 in annual reported fraud.
Perhaps the most disturbing statistics were from the elderly age group.
- $4.9 billion lost
- Average loss was $83,000
- 43% increase in losses from 2023
We definitely need to provide better protection for the elderly to prevent these crimes.
Use of cryptocurrency in the reported losses exploded from $3.8 billion in 2023 to $9.3 billion in 2024. This is a 250% increase in 2024. And the largest age group with cryptocurrency losses was the elderly at $2.8 billion.
Since maybe only 5–10% of fraud losses are reported, we can estimate total fraud losses at $150–200 billion per year in the US. These are stunning numbers!
Even with these massive loss numbers, the US still has no national strategy to combat consumer scams, which make up a large portion of these losses. Why is a national strategy/attack plan so crucial? Because the scammers are no longer just individuals. It is transnational organized crime attacking individual consumers, picking them off one by one. The UN and Operation Shamrock have identified massive scam compounds in Southeast East Asia (and elsewhere) with hundreds of thousands of scammers with the sole focus of stealing money from consumers in almost every country in the world.
There is another ominous threat for the US. With several English-speaking countries actively deploying scam prevention controls (the UK, Australia and New Zealand), the scammers will put more emphasis on the US, a country that has no requirements for scam controls or money mule controls. So, expect the numbers to grow in 2025.
There are, however, two potential bright spots in the US. In April 2025, the National Elder Fraud Coordination Center (NEFCC) opened in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. CEO Brady Finta, former FBI Supervisory Special Agent, is putting together a team to work with law enforcement and private sector companies to help aggregate elder Individual fraud cases into large cases and go after the criminals. This is patterned after the successful San Diego Elder Justice Task Force.
The second initiative is the Aspen Institute National Task Force for Fraud & Scam Prevention. This task force includes financial institutions, digital platforms, telcos, consumer non-profits and the US government. The goal of this task force is to define actionable solutions to prevent fraud and scams in the US. These solutions will be announced in Q4 2025.
But now, US financial institutions, where the money leaves the scam victim accounts, need to do more. They should follow the lead of the UK, Australian and New Zealand bankers and add a scam strategy with scam controls and money mule controls. Digital platforms that operate in the US need to add the same controls they are already deploying in the UK and Australia. Telcos need to do more to block international scam calls and to block scam text messages. We continue to see a more aggressive telco response in the UK, Europe and Australia.
Also, more states should have laws that 1) allow banks to hold suspicious transactions involving elderly customers with a safe harbor for banks and 2) have daily limits on crypto ATM deposits and 3) require elderly bank customers to name a “trusted person” for banks to notify for suspicious transactions.
We can make a difference in the US, but it requires a whole-of-ecosystem response with individual entities and government committed to actional solutions to fight these scams.",,"breach, fraud, investment fraud, scam",4,2025-04-30,"FBI 2024 Fraud Statistics: UP, UP, and AWAY! | Outseer. FBI 2024 Fraud Statistics: UP, UP, and AWAY!
In April 2025, the FBI released its annual Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) fraud report. To no one’s surprise, the losses in 2024 grew. It is at $16.6 billion, up 33% from 2023. For the past five years, IC3 has reported $50.5 billion in cumulative losses. And that total is just for crimes reported by consumers and businesses.
What is most interesting is how cleanly the IC3 breaks out the fraud data for analysis. So, let’s unpack this report. Chart 1 contains the crime type categories by dollars lost.
Chart 1: Crime Type Categories by Dollars Lost
Investment scams, at $6.6 billion have shot to the top, almost doubled since 2022. Business Email Compromises (BEC) have leveled off for the past three years at $2.8 billion, but still high given this fraud category began around 2011. Companies just don’t learn.
Tech Support scams are up $500 million since 2023 to $1.464 billion and have risen almost 87% since 2022.
Confidence Fraud/Romance is up slightly since 2023 but down 9% since 2022. This is probably down, with the big increase in pig butchering (a combination of romance and investment) probably included under investment fraud.
A few other interesting loss numbers:
- Cryptocurrency was involved in $9.3 billion of the $16.6 billion total losses (56%). This was mainly in BEC and investment scams and some Confidence/Romance and Tech Support scams. In 2023, cryptocurrency was involved in 3.8 billion. So, there has been a 250% increase in the use of cryptocurrency in 2024.
- 60+ (elderly) fraud losses were $4.8 billion (more on this later)
- Gold courier scams had $219 million in losses. This is where scammers use couriers to pick up cash and gold from customers under one of many ruses. This is happening across the country. Here is a story in April 2025. “Two men were arrested for their involvement in ‘courier scams’ in Maryland, resulting in victims losing over $700,000.” In San Diego, CA, police have arrested many couriers for picking up gold and cash from victims, according to the San Diego District Attorney’s office.
- Call center scams were up to $1.9 billion in losses. This was mainly in tech support and cryptocurrency exchange situations.
- Average loss was $19,372.
Every age group is getting scammed. This is consistent with some recent information I received from a US bank which confirmed that all age segments are successfully being attacked by the scammers. The additional point they made was the vast majority of the losses were suffered by the elderly.
Chart 2 shows the numbers of scams and dollar losses by age group. You can see in the chart the number of reported incidents was fairly evenly spilt between the age groups. The last three age groups suffer the most because that is where more wealth has been built up.
Chart 2: Numbers of Scams and Dollar Losses
This year the FBI IC3 report has a special section on elderly fraud losses. It is important that the report has a special section on elderly fraud losses, as the losses per incident are much higher for the elderly and they have no time or ability to recoup these losses. These losses can be financially and emotionally devastating. The key elderly loss statistics are in Chart 3.
Chart 3: Key Elderly Statistics
The elderly lost $4.9 billion in 2023. The average reported loss for the elderly is now $83,000. These may be the most important statistics in this report. And 7500 complainants lost over $100,000. Also, there was a 43% increase in losses from 2023 for the elderly. This is a very disturbing trend.
In another section of the report, there is more breakdown of top elderly dollar losses by crime types: Investment losses for elderly were $1.8 billion, Tech Support was $900 million, Confidence/Romance was almost $400 million and government impersonation over $200 million. Cryptocurrency was involved in $2.8 billion of the fraud (58%).
It is exciting to see the newly established National Elder Fraud Coordination Center (NEFCC) open this month, just as the IC3 report was released. One of the primary goals of the NEFCC is to bring the criminals who attack the elderly to justice. Watch for important results as this year unfolds.
When the fraudsters commit the fraud/scams, there are several key ways the money moves. Chart 4 shows this.
Chart 4: Top Ways Funds Are Lost in Fraud
Notice how cryptocurrency and wire transfers lead the money outflow, with cryptocurrency the number one way. Some states are now limiting the daily crypto ATM deposit limit to $1000. This daily limit should be law in every state. Also, these statistics put financial institutions on call to add strong controls to prevent money mules. This includes strengthening account opening controls and having inbound transaction monitoring.
The report also breaks out losses by state. Chart 5 shows the top states by complaints and number of losses.

FCA Approve Spending Patterns as a Valid Inherence Element for SCA | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/fca-approve-spending,2021-12-07,"FCA Approve Spending Patterns as a Valid Inherence Element for SCA
The FCA made an announcement that affects shoppers’ experience when online. Read all about it here!
A keenly awaited announcement by the FCA on 29th November should be good news for any organization with stakes in eCommerce and, just as importantly, their customers.
What the FCA has confirmed – in a lengthy guidance document and now abridged by me – is that spending patterns that identify a cardholder can be considered in the approval or authentication process when an individual pays using a credit or any other eCommerce card.
But don’t take my word for it – the actual FCA policy statement gives us the official line:
“In our view, inherence can be defined as a characteristic attributable to a person, including behavioral analytics, such as spending patterns. We have added this clarification in our updated guidance.”
This means that a transaction can be considered as authenticated under SCA rules, without the need for additional biometric technologies such as fingerprint scanning, voice recognition or hand and face geometry that some individuals may be unable or unwilling to provide.
Put more technically, the FCA ruling allows for spending patterns (using EMV 3DS data profiling) that identify the cardholder to be considered as inherence in the Strong Consumer Authentication (SCA) process to authenticate an individual performing an eCommerce card not present (CNP) transaction.
The inherence elements of SCA are used to verify that the authorizing party is the actual payer. The use of a cardholder’s EMV 3DS profile data does exactly this.
So why is this such good news?
Frictionless customer experiences, “top of wallet’’ loyalty and inclusion spring to my mind.
When we know what real customer behavior looks like we can use this knowledge to transparently authenticate the transaction, and only highly suspicious activity is sent through step-up authentication. This process ensures a frictionless flow for legitimate transactions and other activities and helps protect the user‘s experience when they’re shopping online.
A positive, frictionless customer experience helps build “top of wallet” loyalty
When transaction success rates increase due to seamless cardholder experiences, businesses grow. The less friction there is, the better it is for business.
With so much focus on online and mobile shopping now and no signs of a downturn – what card am I going to use? I’m going to go for the one that allows a quicker, seamless transaction and I think I’m a fairly typical shopper. And just like other consumers, I don’t expect to sacrifice any security along the way.
Inclusive authentication helps bridge the digital divide
I’m not alone in welcoming the inclusion of behavioral analytics as a means of authenticating an individual as a huge step forward towards practical authentication for everyone. Any organization committed to financial inclusivity will be. For them, leveraging spending patterns in general, and EMV 3DS data in particular, as an inherence factor is also the right thing to do.
3DS profiling helps to prove the ID of vulnerable customers and those that cannot or prefer not to use biometric authentication. These are individuals who may not easily be able to provide inherence information or the behavioral biometrics required by elements such as fingerprint scanning, voice recognition or hand and face geometry. The FCA decision means such elements are non-compulsory in proving cardholder identity.
So businesses should take heed that their products and services, including the means to pay for them, should be accessible to one and all.
Confidence that helps businesses grow
Of course, one can stop 100% of fraudulent transactions by declining 100% of them but that’s hardly a desirable business outcome. However, Outseer provides seamless fraud protection that defeats both fraud and user friction at the same time. Through machine learning, data science, and advanced risk scoring, Outseer precision detection prevents 95% of all fraudulent transactions, with intervention rates (challenge or decline) as low as 5%. That’s the best performance in the industry.
Fraud detection rates are also important to benefit from SCA exemptions therefore it’s important to choose a vendor that keeps fraud rates low.
In addition, as shown in a recent research by Aite-Novarica Group, when both the issuers and merchants equitably participating in 3-D Secure, everyone benefits. In Europe for example, where the majority of your CNP volume going through 3-D Secure rails, overall net fraud is down, net 3-D Secure fraud rates are even lower and customer attrition is lower.
The research also shows that CNP authorization rates are statistically, significantly higher when using 3-D Secure. In the EU for example, 77% of merchants surveyed responded that they achieve 85% or higher authorization rates when using 3-D Secure.
Summary:
Seamless shopping experiences and mitigating fraud shouldn’t be a battle. Leveraging EMV 3DS profiling as an inherence factor can help ensure convenient and secure transactions. With Outseer 3-D Secure precision detection, organizations can be confident that their EMV 3DS profiling is performing at its best. Outseer has over a decade of science-driven innovation in anti-fraud and payments authentication solutions and is passionate about innovating highly secure solutions in the card-not-present payments environment.

These are individuals who may not easily be able to provide inherence information or the behavioral biometrics required by elements such as fingerprint scanning, voice recognition or hand and face geometry. The FCA decision means such elements are non-compulsory in proving cardholder identity.
So businesses should take heed that their products and services, including the means to pay for them, should be accessible to one and all.
Confidence that helps businesses grow
Of course, one can stop 100% of fraudulent transactions by declining 100% of them but that’s hardly a desirable business outcome. However, Outseer provides seamless fraud protection that defeats both fraud and user friction at the same time. Through machine learning, data science, and advanced risk scoring, Outseer precision detection prevents 95% of all fraudulent transactions, with intervention rates (challenge or decline) as low as 5%. That’s the best performance in the industry.
Fraud detection rates are also important to benefit from SCA exemptions therefore it’s important to choose a vendor that keeps fraud rates low.
In addition, as shown in a recent research by Aite-Novarica Group, when both the issuers and merchants equitably participating in 3-D Secure, everyone benefits. In Europe for example, where the majority of your CNP volume going through 3-D Secure rails, overall net fraud is down, net 3-D Secure fraud rates are even lower and customer attrition is lower.
The research also shows that CNP authorization rates are statistically, significantly higher when using 3-D Secure. In the EU for example, 77% of merchants surveyed responded that they achieve 85% or higher authorization rates when using 3-D Secure.
Summary:
Seamless shopping experiences and mitigating fraud shouldn’t be a battle. Leveraging EMV 3DS profiling as an inherence factor can help ensure convenient and secure transactions. With Outseer 3-D Secure precision detection, organizations can be confident that their EMV 3DS profiling is performing at its best. Outseer has over a decade of science-driven innovation in anti-fraud and payments authentication solutions and is passionate about innovating highly secure solutions in the card-not-present payments environment.

Following the Fraud: What New UK Research Reveals About Money Mule Networks | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/following-the-fraud-new-research-about-money-mule-networks,2025-09-24,"Following the Fraud: What New UK Research Reveals About Money Mule Networks
New RUSI research with Lloyds data reveals how money mule accounts move millions through faster payments and digital banks — and why better cross-bank data sharing is critical.
Why Money Mules Are a National Security Threat
The stark role that money mules play in undermining the UK digital economy has been highlighted in research by the Royal United Services Industry (RUSI), using data from Lloyds bank. They draw on previous comments they made about fraud (which makes up 40%+ of UK reported crime) being a ‘national security threat.’
This research is one of the first times a forensic lens has been applied to where money goes when it leaves a mule account. Until now, the focus has been identifying mule accounts via the money going into them — something which the UK PSR regulations last year forced most UK banks to concentrate on.
How Money Moves: Faster Payments, Cards, and Cash
This study looked at two months’ worth of data in 2024 analyzing the outflows of money from identified mules. The outcome of this is revealing:
- £7.2M was moved from mule accounts
- Mostly sent by Faster Payments — 57%
- Next most common was debit cards — 20%
- Then cash via ATM or Branches — 10%
There isn’t much surprise that Faster Payments was the preferred choice, but this figure is probably down compared to 2023 as this is when UK banks started to focus on money mule detection.
The Oversized Role of Digital Banks and Payment Providers
However, when we look at the faster payments there was a concentration of funds going to newer digital banks or payment platforms (who might not have invested as much in mule detection):
- 38% to three payment providers/digital banks (i.e., not a traditional financial institution)
- 20% actually went to a single provider
It is known that some payment companies have been providing virtual IBANs and it is probable that they were abused in some of these cases. It shows their controls are not as mature as established banks.
Cards as a Cashout
Looking at the debit cards more trends can be seen:
- High value large amounts to a particular retailer (Typical buying goods that command a high resale value – such as technology items or watches)
- Smaller value but higher volume payments to Money transfer, foreign exchange or crypto exchanges
- A lot of mundane spending on food, drink, taxis — average payment £107
From a card and 3DS perspective it highlights how increased data sharing between channels in banks is needed; being able to take insights from digital banking into risk scoring for card use (and vice versa) is going to grow over time.
Mule Account Ages
Looking at the age of the mules’ accounts gives insights into how well an established bank is detecting mules:
- 20% of mules were older than five years
- The majority are older than one year
This differs to other banks where Outseer has been co-creating our mule detection; with them newer accounts being used more — the ‘Complicit’ mules from the FBI definition. At Lloyds it appears more ‘Witting’ mules where accounts go from good to bad, either due to people needing money or selling on accounts without appreciating the consequences.
The Speed of Cashouts
The last metric of interest is the speed of money movement:
- Often money left the mule account in less than 15 mins
- Over half of funds moved within an hour
- Less than 15% let in mule account after 24 hours
It shows how Faster Payments equals Faster Fraud! The operational capabilities behind the money mule network should not be underestimated, these are organized criminal networks and they know how exploit financial systems.
Unanswered Questions
One thing that wasn’t referenced to was Open Banking — it is known to be used in some scams to pull money into mule accounts, but there seems to be no usage of it to move money onwards from them. For scams it is being used as there is less awareness of it and not mentioned much in customer education.
Another unanswered question is what happens to the cash — does that go back into other accounts, or is it used in a similar way to debit cards to transfer money overseas via money transfer companies? Or it is being deposited into crypto ATMs — it is common in the USA for scam victims to directly deposit into them. The only way to get more intel on this tracking and arresting a mule as he has the cash.
The Wider Money Laundering Issue
One thing is for certain — this stolen money is being concentrated elsewhere as part of a money laundering process (the final integration stage). Whether this is happening within the UK or overseas is unknown.
Also, Mules are not just used for APP scam cashouts — they are needed for all forms of financial crime as they are actually low-level money laundering. As RUSI says we need to better understand the end-to-end flow of money in mules — not just spotting the mule account.
Final Thoughts
As the UK took the lead on mule detection, this shows how financial institutions must now go beyond that and collaborate on outflow analysis. The next phase of fraud defense will be defined by cross-bank intelligence and real-time data sharing. Outseer continues to lead with our mule detection development that looks at both inward and outward payments.",,"fraud, money laundering, scam",3,2025-09-24,"Following the Fraud: What New UK Research Reveals About Money Mule Networks | Outseer.

Fraud Analytics: How It Works to Detect & Prevent Fraud | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/fraud-analytics,2022-04-18,"Fraud Analytics: How It Works to Detect & Prevent Fraud
Wondering about fraud analytics? We explain what fraud analytics is, how it works to detect and prevent fraud, and its benefits for your organization.
What Is Fraud Analytics?
Fraud analytics refers to the process of leveraging data mining, machine learning, and applied data science to understand, detect, and prevent fraudulent transactions.
Online fraud attacks continue to rise each year and show no signs of slowing down. In Q3 of 2021, Outseer recorded more than 156,000 fraud attacks worldwide—a 30% increase over the same quarter a year earlier. During that same period, attacks involving brand abuse climbed 274%, and the use of rogue mobile apps grew almost 50%.
According to the FBI, U.S. consumers and businesses lost more than $6.9 billion to fraud attacks in 2021—a 66% increase over the previous year. And that’s on top of $7.9 billion in card-not-present (CNP) fraud and $6 billion lost to account takeover (ATO).
Fraud prevention systems rely on fraud analytics to detect the telltale signs of fraud before it can harm businesses or customers. Generally speaking, fraud analytics involves gathering data from a large, high-quality dataset and mining it to establish baseline patterns that can be used to predict and stop future fraud attacks. Analytics tools can also be used to measure performance and finetune controls for continuous improvement.
Here are some of the benefits businesses can expect to see from their fraud analytics.
Benefits of Fraud Analytics
By collecting and processing transactional and user data, businesses can gain deep insight into fraud attempts, insider attacks, and account takeovers. But again, the size and quality of the dataset better. Shared data spanning thousands of companies, sectors, and geographies net the best results. With the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence, automation can immediately take corrective action when these threats are detected.
Reduce Costs
Many organizations choose to partner with a fraud prevention services to help monitor their systems and build threat models to prevent instances of fraud within their businesses. Leveraging services that use artificial intelligence eliminates countless hours of manual research during a fraud investigation.
Fraud analytics allow organizations to be proactive in defeating fraud. By staying ahead of attacks, businesses avoid embarrassing and costly data breaches that jeopardize their customers and intellectual property.
Protect Your Brand
With brand abuse attacks at the forefront of fraud trends, businesses have a lot more to lose than just their revenue. Fraudsters impersonate brands by exploiting their brand identity an consumer trust to trick their prey into handing over payment details.
Brand abuse scams not only steal payment details from their victims, they also quickly tarnish the brands they impersonate. Even when a company has no idea it’s being impersonated, customers often hold that brand accountable for the fraud.
For consumers who fall prey to these impersonations, the average loss is $1,000—though it can get distressingly higher. When it’s a large business that’s victimized, these attacks can lead to an average $5 million in loss. When impersonation attacks lead to a data breach, it costs US-based companies another $9.05 million on average, per incident. And depending on the industry, attendant regulatory fines can run as high as $487,000 or more.
That’s just the start of things. Get impersonated, and your brand could take a hit to reputation and revenue as your customers and prospects grow wary of your legitimate digital marketing campaigns and channels. According to Forrester, lost customer trust and even heightened customer suspicion can impact a company’s revenue by 10% to 25% in a single year.
Cyberattack detection and takedown services leveraging fraud analytics to identify when malicious actors are attempting to impersonate a brand. Spoofed domain names, fake social media accounts, phony brand smartphone apps, and phishing sites can all be detected and removed before they can cause serious financial or reputational harm.
Protect Customers
Even when businesses do everything right, it still might not be enough to stop fraud. Between data breaches and dark web marketplaces, your customers’ stolen data could be beyond your control. Armed with compromised payment details or login credentials, fraudsters can sign on to customer accounts, change security settings, make purchases, view sensitive data, and more.
Before fraud analytics, preventing these attacks wasn’t easy. Many businesses relied solely on security questions or onetime passcodes that are easy for experienced fraudsters to bypass.
Today, artificial intelligence combined with modern data science and shared transaction data can understand the context behind a user login or transaction to separate friend from faux. This is done by collecting metrics such as device ID and geographical location and comparing it to typical user behavior.
Each unusual or suspicious behavior adds to the overall risk score for the login or transaction attempt. Once risk thresholds established by the organization are met, the user can be prompted to authenticate through a challenge flow or block the transaction entirely.
Putting Fraud Analytics into Action
Here are a few tips you can use to collect fraud analytics in your organization:
- Develop a fraud risk assessment program to determine areas of potential fraud.
- Determine your organization’s risk tolerance and prioritize actions accordingly.
- Assign someone to oversee your fraud monitoring system.
- Implement case management measures and reporting mechanisms
- Identify and continuously monitor for evolving indicators of compromise.
For most organizations this is easier said than done, of course. That’s why businesses partner with providers that offer comprehensive, turnkey solutions.
Case in point: Outseer. From our payment fraud and account monitoring solutions to our 24/7 cyberattack detection and takedown services, our fraud analytics expertise enables us to prevent 95% of all fraud loss, with customer intervention rates as low as 5%.

Wondering about fraud detection and machine learning? We explain how they work together, and how machine learning is advancing fraud detection technology.
How Does Fraud Detection Work with Machine Learning?
Machine learning analyzes customers’ behavioral patterns and transaction history to assess transaction risk and flag suspicious activities.
Machine learning algorithms recognize the behavior of fraudsters by comparing established customer behavioral baselines to different models of known fraud. Different customer actions or characteristics can result in a high- or low-risk score. Credit card companies, banks, payments processors, and others use this kind of real-time analysis to protect themselves from fraud in accordance with their risk tolerance and business objectives.
What Is Fraud Detection?
Fraud detection is the process of recognizing and preventing unauthorized or illegal activities or transactions. Fraud detection leverages machine learning, statistical analysis, and behavioral monitoring to identify activities, patterns or other characteristics that signal fraud.
For example, if there’s an attempt to infiltrate a customer account through an automated bot that tests a new set of login details every second, fraud detection systems should be able to identify it as a potential attack.
In this particular scenario, the system may automatically send an email alert reporting suspicious activity to the legitimate account holder. It can also present a CAPTCHA or other challenge to prevent the bot from testing additional logins.
Likewise, fraud detection systems should be able to recognize when cyberthieves attempt to place purchases using stolen credit card numbers.
Today, most fraud detection is automated. This frees human analysts to focus on more urgent cases, maintain the system, and assess case resolution and false positive data to continually improve machine learning models.
What Exactly Is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a form of data analysis that automatically builds analytical models from data points. When used for fraud detection, machine learning algorithms can identify patterns within these models and make predictions about its legitimacy.
Machine learning leverages an abundance of customer and fraud data to produce highly accurate models that can uncover behavioral patterns. Fraud prevention systems use machine learning to assign a risk score based on behavior.
As an example, the Outseer Risk Engine analyzes over 100 different intelligence to assess risk. Metrics such as location, device ID, and transaction history are all taken into account. If the machine learning algorithm determines a high likelihood of fraud, the transaction is assigned a high-risk score.
By combining globally-shared identity and transaction data, machine learning methods, and case management feedback, Outseer dramatically reduces fraud loss while boosting approval rates on legitimate transactions to enable higher growth and profitability.
How Does Machine Learning Help Detect Fraud?
Before machine learning, fraud detection often relied solely on signature-based mechanisms that would store known threats inside a database library and then blocking threats that matched a signature. This was costly, error prone, and difficult to apply at scale. Fraudsters quickly realized they could introduce randomness in their attacks to avoid detection.
Modern machine learning, on the other hand, can read between the lines and identify fraud based on the context for, and the relationship behind a transaction, rather than exact techniques or methods. This can include variables such as the type of payment being made, whether the payee account has received payment from the user in the past, is the amount characteristic of the user’s payment, and so on. This approach helps businesses stay ahead of new and emerging attacks, even when fraudsters change up their strategies.
Machine learning models are flexible, allowing them to identify numerous types of fraud and malicious activity. Threats such as card-not-present fraud, chargeback fraud, account takeovers, and account enrollment fraud are all detectable using machine learning statistical models.
Benefits of Machine Learning Fraud Detection
In fraud detection, machine learning is essential to quickly identifying deviations from established norms for each customer and transaction. But it’s also complex. To optimize effectiveness while maximizing cost efficiencies, credit card issuers, financial institutions, and others can benefit from fully-hosted solutions that seamlessly integrate advanced machine learning-based fraud detection into their operations.
These benefits include:
Speed
With machine learning, it takes mere milliseconds to assess the risk associated with each transaction or activity. This allows businesses to apply fraud detection processes to every transaction without slowing down or interfering with the customer experience—even as cybercriminals evolve their attacks.
Scalability
Writing up rules and maintaining signature libraries can grow more costly, time consuming, and error-prone as transaction volumes grow. But the advent of world-class hosted solutions enable organizations to leverage endlessly-scalable, machine learning-enabled fraud detection at affordable rates.
Accuracy
The performance of machine learning models improves with the growth and quality of the dataset it leverages. The more examples of legitimate and fraudulent transactions, the better and faster ML models can distinguish customers from criminals and predictively apply that knowledge to future transactions. For this reason, enriching proprietary data with high-quality identity and transaction intelligence from trusted sources spanning every industry and region provides an additional layer of certainty to every risk decision.
Efficiency
Machine learning enables risk analysis across hundreds or tens of thousands of transactions per second, 24/7. Instead of wasting valuable human resources on endlessly repetitive and tedious tasks, machine learning-based solutions escalate only the scant few suspicious transactions that ever warrant further scrutiny. As a result, security teams are free to focus on far more strategic tasks and initiatives.

Fraud Investigation: Simply Explained | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/fraud-investigation,2021-10-07,"Fraud Investigation: Simply Explained
Are you wondering about fraud investigations? We explain key aspects of fraud investigation, from determining whether fraud has occurred to resolving it.
What Is a Fraud Investigation?
A fraud investigation is a process to determine whether fraudulent activity has occurred.
A fraud investigation aims to understand what behavior occurred, who was responsible, and how it was done. Conducting thorough investigations allows businesses to mitigate damage quickly and potentially avoid fines, financial loss, and reputational damage.
Failing to discover the early signs of fraud can have a devastating impact over time. Thankfully, companies can quickly identify the presence of fraud with the aid of machine learning technology.
What Triggers a Fraud Investigation?
Activity that triggers a fraud investigation will vary depending on the type of fraud. For example, expense claim scams are discovered through receipt discrepancies, while investigators can uncover identity theft through address verification and charge disputes. Let’s review some of the most common types of fraudulent transactions.
Some common types of fraud include the following:
- Card-Not-Present (CNP) Fraud: When a cybercriminal steals a cardholder’s payment card information and uses it to make elicit purchases.
- Friendly Fraud: Otherwise known as chargeback or credit card dispute fraud, friendly fraud occurs when a cardholder disputes a transaction and receives a chargeback under false pretense or because an unsupervised child or other family member has used the card or made in-app purchases without the cardholder’s knowledge.
- Fraudulent Account Activity: Access or criminal behavior perpetrated by a legitimate user or by a cybercriminal through account takeover that can lead to a data breach or other losses.
Common signs of fraud can include the following:
- Sudden large purchases or withdrawals
- Numerous chargebacks or purchase disputes
- Customer complaints
- Changes to account details, such as password and authorized user
No matter what type of fraud you’re dealing with, starting your investigation from a solid foundation will help you assess the situation, remediate the issue, and document evidence to report your findings.
How to Conduct a Fraud Investigation
Determine Scope
Outline exactly what you’re looking to understand throughout the investigation. Use the intelligence gathered to substantiate that fraud has occurred, and if so, what applications, users, and information are impacted. Keeping a narrow and clearly defined scope helps keep investigations on track and determines what you may need to report to regulators if a cybercrime has occurred.
Your scope is likely to change as the investigation moves forward and new information emerges. It’s normal for the scope of an investigation to be updated as new evidence provokes additional questions.
Develop a Strategy
Develop a clear strategy to ensure the right information is gathered. Consider the nature of the suspected fraud and identify possible sources of intel. Some information might require coordination across multiple departments and teams. Outline what information you’ll need and who can provide it, including the following:
- What do I need to know?
- How will I get that information?
- Who do I need to interview?
- Are there any suspects at this time?
- What was the login activity during the time period in question?
- What documentation will I use to prove or disprove the crime?
Collect Evidence
Once an organization has identified the possibility of fraud, it’s important to not only collect evidence quickly, but also to prevent it from being deleted or destroyed.
When the clock is ticking, clear communication is vital. Make requests for information as soon as possible to avoid accidental deletion. For example, many log files are overwritten after a certain amount of time.
Requesting this data quickly and communicating its urgency helps avoid any loss of evidence. It’s important to remember your scope while collecting evidence to protect the rights of others and avoid slowing down the process with irrelevant information.
Examples of evidence can include the following:
- Emails
- Documents stored on computers or external hard drives
- Text messages on company phones
- Log files
- Metadata
- Electronic records
If you think data may have been deleted, ask your IT department for recovery options. If your organization takes incremental backups, there’s a chance IT staff can find information from a previous snapshot before it was deleted. If it’s a purchase dispute, gather relevant information about the transaction from the merchant and the customer.
Report Your Findings
When reporting your findings, consider who your audience will be. Insurance companies, stakeholders, law enforcement, and regulatory agencies may all need to view the report. Fraud investigation reports can be used to file insurance claims to recover financial losses and leveraged in criminal cases against a subject.
In terms of chargebacks or other forms of transaction fraud, issuers and banks have 30 days to acknowledge a customer’s claim. And if they determine that a transaction in question is fraudulent, or if there is a larger pattern of fraudulent purchases in play (especially ones that cross state lines), the FBI should be notified.
Avoiding Fraud in The First Place
Fraud costs issuers, the merchants, customers, and cardholders a tremendous amount of money—and so do the investigations to resolve them.
Losses from CNP fraud, most of which comes in the form of chargebacks, could top $26 billion this year. But total losses go far beyond just revenue. By some estimates, every $1 in chargebacks leads to up to $3 in additional costs. Transaction fraud costs companies as much as 5% of their total revenues.
When fraud comes through the form of criminal logins or activities that lead to a data breach, it can cost an average of $9.01 million per incident for U.S. companies, thanks to the costs of investigations, remediation, and more.
Indeed, fraud investigations are time- and resource-intensive. They can also often be avoided through fraud prevention systems that can proactively stop attacks before they impact business.
Tools like Outseer 3-D Secure and Outseer Fraud Manager, for instance, leverage data science and statistical analysis to protect businesses from fraud by preventing it in the first place. Machine learning identifies the patterns and behaviors of fraudsters and uses that knowledge to stop future fraud.
Behind the scenes, the Outseer Risk Engine leverages global identity and transaction data to analyze over 100 indicators used to evaluate risk and assign each action with a risk score. The risk score reflects the probability of an event being fraudulent based on predictors and known facts. Data such as location, device type, and time of day help uncover each behavior’s context and the true intentions of a user.
Actions that require additional scrutiny are sent through step-up authentication. This process stops cybercriminals and bots by requiring additional identification to proceed. Oftentimes this is via a text or email verification message but can also include voice and biometric authentication. Businesses can fine-tune this process through Outseer’s Policy Manager in accordance with their risk tolerance and business objectives.
By understanding what real customer behavior looks like, only highly suspicious activity is sent through step-up authentication. This process ensures a frictionless flow for legitimate transactions and other activities and helps protect the user experience when interacting with a brand.

Wondering about fraud management? We explain what fraud management is, how it works, and what solutions are available.
What Is Fraud Management?
Fraud management encompasses all methods of detecting and preventing fraud. This process involves identifying areas where fraud can occur, assessing your fraud risk tolerance, and deploying systems to prevent and mitigate fraud activities.
Fraud management is now more important than ever. As more financial transactions move to mobile and online channels, banks, credit card companies, payment processors and other organizations are faced with the challenge of ensuring those transactions are both legitimate and secure.
That’s because cybercriminal networks always follow the money—a notion that has led to an avalanche of phishing attacks, bogus mobile apps, authorized push payment rip-offs, Buy Now, Pay Later rackets, and countless other scams designed to fool consumers and businesses into revealing payment and login credentials. According to the Federal Trade Commission, consumer fraud losses jumped 79% in 2021. And the FBI reports that businesses lost $200 million more than the year before. And it’s getting worse.
Across all industries, card-not-present (CNP) fraud alone could lead to $17.3 billion in losses by 2023, according to the Aite-Novarica Group. Meanwhile, account takeover (ATO) contributes to as much as $16.9 billion in annual losses. And then there’s the use of stolen and synthetic identity data in account enrollment fraud, which is a $6 billion problemthe FBI calls one of the fastest-growing forms of financial crime today.
At the heart of it all: Impersonation. Sometimes called “brand exploitation,” “brand abuse,” or even “brand jacking,” cybercriminal impersonation of trusted businesses or individuals soared $274% during the first three quarters of 2001, and is implicated in nearly half (45%) of all cybercrimes worldwide.
With no signs of slowing down, organizations are turning to fraud management solutions to protect their brand, staff, and customers. Let’s explore the four most common types of fraud and what businesses are doing to protect themselves.
Fraud Management Strategies
To stop fraud, we first must understand what to look for. Below are the four most common types of fraud, how they work, and how you can prevent them in your fraud management strategy.
Fraud Management for E-Commerce Fraud
E-commerce fraud is a broad category of attacks that aims to defraud businesses by obtaining merchandise for free or disrupting sales from legitimate customers. With more businesses shifting their efforts to online retail, e-commerce fraud continues to gain popularity and take unsuspecting companies by surprise.
Below are a few common types of e-commerce:
- Card-Not-Present Fraud – The use of compromised credit card details to make unauthorized online or mobile purchases, often using automated bots
- Chargeback Fraud – Occurs when a customer makes a purchase with the intent of issuing a chargeback and keeping the product
- Friendly Fraud – Exactly like chargeback fraud, but is committed on accident when customers forget they made a purchase and facilitate a chargeback
- Automated Scalping – Scalpers use bots and other automated techniques to buy out the inventory and resell it at a higher price to legitimate customers
- Buy Now, Pay Later Fraud – Occurs when fraudsters open a line of credit with no intention of paying it back.
What can you do to prevent these types of payment fraud?
The most successful fraud management strategies include risk-based authentication (RBA) that leverages the EMV® 3-D Secure protocol, which has proven remarkably effective in detecting and preventing payment fraud.
Today’s most robust 3DS-based solutions, for instance, analyze more than 100 different risk indicators to silently authenticate customers before a transaction even occurs. This enables merchants, issuers, and banks to deliver a fast, friendly checkout experience to legitimate customers while blocking fraudsters at the door.
Organizations can set thresholds for different risk scores to reflect their fraud risk tolerance. Transactions deemed too risky are sent through a step-up verification process, while legitimate customers are left unimpacted.
Look for solutions that use artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify bots and bad actors. Unlike rule-based systems, artificial intelligence continuously uses new data to prevent fraud and adapts to new attacks, even when fraudsters change their tactics.
The leading options on the market leverage the same technologies to detect synthetic identities used for buy now, pay later scams and block bots used to scalp products or test stolen card information.
Fraud Management for Brand Abuse
Brand abuse remains one of the most popular forms of fraud due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Brand abusers impersonate trusted brands or individuals to trick employees, customers, suppliers, and others into clicking malicious links, entering their card information, and purchasing counterfeit goods.
For consumers who fall prey to these impersonations, the average loss is $1,000—though it can get much higher. When it’s a large business that’s victimized, these attacks can lead to an average $5 million in loss. When impersonation attacks lead to a data breach, it costs US-based companies another $9.05 million on average, per incident.
Get impersonated, and your brand could also take a hit to its reputation and revenue as your customers and prospects grow wary of your legitimate digital marketing campaigns and channels. According to Forrester, lost customer trust and even just heightened customer suspicion can reduce a company’s revenue by 10% to 25% for up to a year.
Below are a few common types of brand impersonation fraud:
- Phishing Messages – Fraudsters use email, social media, text messages, deepfake voices, and even Zoom meetings in their impersonation scams
- Phony Brand Mobile Apps – Attackers create malicious apps that impersonate a brand in order to steal data, display ads, and install malware
- Domain Spoofing – Fraudsters register domain names that look nearly identical to the real branded domain in order to trick visitors and send convincing phishing emails
- Fake Social Media Accounts – Attackers use fraudulent social media profiles and offers to fool users into costly mistakes
What can you do to prevent brand impersonation?
The best way to prevent and manage brand abuse fraud is to stop it before it can reach your customers. But manually patrolling the Internet for brand abuse is impractical and time-consuming.
Instead, organizations are advised to source fraud intelligence and takedown services that continuously monitor the web, app stores, and social media platforms 24/7 to detect and shut down phishing sites, fraudulent mobile apps, and phony social media pages used in brand impersonation schemes before they can cause serious financial and reputational damage.
Along with continuous brand monitoring, organizations should use an email gateway other solutions that analyze incoming email to prevent any phishing messages that do reach their servers from hitting employee inboxes. Conduct regular training inside your organization to raise awareness of phishing scams to minimize your risk.
Account Takeover Fraud Management
Account takeover (ATO) fraud is notoriously difficult to detect because fraudsters hijack legitimate accounts to carry out attacks. Fraudsters typically gain access to trusted accounts through data breaches and phishing attacks.
Once logged in, attackers use their privileged access to make fraudulent purchases, steal valuable information, add beneficiaries, and max out lines of credit. Up to 71.9% of e-commerce fraud was committed through trusted user accounts during the third quarter of 2021. These attacks can leave both customers and businesses blindsided if not prevented.
Below are a few common crimes perpetrated in account takeover:
- Changing Account Information – Attackers typically change account information to lock out customers and move money or products to the attacker
- Making Fraudulent Purchases – Fraudsters take advantage of saved credit card information to make purchases after they change the shipping address
- Maxing Out Credit Limits – Attackers max out accounts with Buy Now, Pay Later services to burn through their credit limits
- Steal Sensitive Information – Accounts can contain other information like social security numbers, bank and credit card details, phone numbers, and more that can be used in more advanced attacks or sold in dark web marketplaces
- Selling Stolen Accounts – Rather than using the hijacked accounts, some criminals sell them to other fraudsters to exploit at will
What can you do to prevent these types of fraud?
Unlike traditional password authentication, modern fraud management solutions leverage machine learning to detect account compromise by tracking behavioral norms for each user and watching for anomalous behaviors, devices, locations and other characteristics that could signal fraud. This technique allows companies to identify signs of an ATO and immediately block transactions.
When an account behaves in a way that is indicative of ATO fraud, that user is sent through a challenge flow that requires additional authentication. This extra step can be customized, but it usually comes in the form of one-time password sent via text, email, or authenticator app. When the challenge is complete, the login may proceed.
These systems don’t rely on passwords alone and only request step-up verification if the login is considered high risk.
Internal Fraud Management
Fraud doesn’t always come from outside the organization. Disgruntled staff, curious employees, and deadline-stressed managers might be tempted to commit fraud with their privileged access. Even the most close-knit of teams should have an internal fraud management solution.
Below are a few common types of internal fraud:
- Misappropriation of Funds – Embezzlement and mishandling of company finances are two common examples of misappropriation of funds
- Theft – Theft can include private data, company property, reward points, and cash
- Misuse of Company Assets – When staff use company property for personal gain it can be considered misuse
- Fraudulent Bookkeeping and Reporting – Managers may purposely misreport finances, assets, losses, and other company metrics to meet deadlines or hit goals
What can you do to prevent internal fraud?
The best way to manage internal fraud is to set up policies, detection systems, and assign team leaders to oversee anti-fraud measures. Start with identifying all systems that could be vulnerable to abuse. This could range from manipulating quarterly reporting to accessing a company printer for personal use.
Implement access controls as well as checks and balances for each system on your list. For example, wire transfers should require secondary authorization while company supplies should be secured and a formal mechanism in place for checking them out.
Finally, assign someone to oversee that these fraud management systems are working. Typically this task is assigned to the head of each department. The same solutions used to prevent account takeover can be leveraged to prevent and alert to internal fraud based on actions and behavior. These systems can also aid in case management during a fraud investigation.
In-House vs. Outsourced Fraud Management
Fraud management and prevention are complicated processes involving statistical analysis, data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. This is why many companies choose to partner with a trusted fraud prevention company.
In addition to fraud management expertise and cutting-edge technologies, market-leading providers also provide something nearly impossible for organizations to access on their own: globally-shared, cross-industry identity and transaction data. Without it, even organizations with sizable data sharing consortiums will find it nearly impossible to protect against rapidly-evolving fraud techniques.
What to Look for in Fraud Management Solutions
With so many fraud management solutions, finding the right one for you can feel daunting. While you’re searching keep in mind your overall goal and keep an eye out for a few of these key features:
- Frictionless Flow – Look for solutions that offer frictionless flow. This means their fraud prevention system only stops high-risk transactions, providing customers with a better experience and your company a higher conversion rate.
- Machine Learning – You’ll want a fraud management system that uses machine learning to adapt to the latest threats and accurately flag high-risk behavior. Machine learning is key for scaling and staying ahead of cybercriminals.
- Intelligence Network – Fraud prevention systems require a vast amount of data to accurately identify fraud. Make sure your fraud management system uses a vast network to gain the latest threat intelligence.

Fraud Monitoring: Why Every Company Needs It | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/fraud-monitoring,2022-08-18,"Fraud Monitoring: Why Every Company Needs It
Wondering about fraud monitoring? We explain what fraud monitoring is, how to accomplish it, and the business benefits for your company.
What Is Fraud Monitoring?
Fraud monitoring is the process of continuously scanning all account activity and transactions to identify signs of fraud. Modern, risk-based anti-fraud systems can analyze vast amounts of data to spot anomalies and flag those transactions.
To accomplish this, today’s most robust fraud monitoring solutions leverage statistical analysis and data models. By continuously feeding these models with data on legitimate and fraudulent transactions and interactions, algorithms can be trained to tell the difference between the two.
Using this approach, businesses can protect themselves and their brands from both common and emerging forms of fraud while preserving the customer experience.
Why Is Fraud Monitoring Vital?
As modern society moves to a more convenient, digital world, hackers have new opportunities to hack digital transactions. The US Federal Trade Commission states that more than 2.8M consumers reported losing over $5.8 billion to fraud in 2021. To compare, this is almost 70% more than the same indicator of 2020.
According to PwC, the main threat comes from external perpetrators. The results of the survey, conducted with 1,296 executives from 53 countries, showed that nearly 70% of organizations were affected by disruptive incidents coming from external attacks.
Source: PwC’s Global Economic Crime and Fraud Survey 2022
The number of fraud-affected people in 2021 is the highest on record, dating back to 2021. Estimations show frauds make victims lose $500 on average. Here is why fraud monitoring is no longer a novelty but a necessity for businesses and organizations.

How Does Fraud Monitoring Work?
Risk-based fraud monitoring compares each transaction to statistical models and assigns the transaction a risk score. These scores are numeric values that convey the risk associated with a transaction based on data collected from the session, user, device, and more. Organizations can establish different flows for transactions that reach certain risk thresholds, and customize fraud prevention measures to suit their risk tolerance and company policies.
Datasets used to accomplish this can include hundreds of different indicators to identify malicious activity. Increasingly, it also involves cyber-intelligence and takedown services to detect and neutralize fraudsters targeting the organization’s customers outside perimeter defenses. The following are three common forms of fraud monitoring in use today.
Transaction Monitoring
Monitoring each customer transaction is vital for fraud prevention. Machine-learning algorithms are continuously refined to establish what legitimate customer activity looks like in order to instantly surface anomalous behavior that could signal fraud.
Source: Outseer Fraud Manager Solution
Actions such as updating payment information, adding a beneficiary, or changing contact information are also recorded and weighed when assessing risk and uncovering fraudulent trends.
Examples of transactional data can include the following:
- Purchase history
- Transaction amount
- Device IP address
- Geolocation
- Age of the account
Transaction monitoring also uncovers patterns that indicate potential fraud attempts. Understanding these patterns and monitoring for them can help you prevent financial loss and data theft. For instance, the following actions could indicate an account has been compromised:
- A login occurs from a new IP address
- The login does not match the geographical location of previous sessions
- The user checks the account balance
- The user attempts to change the password but cannot
- The user attempts to issue multiple large transactions
The longer transaction monitoring is in place, the better machine learning algorithms will get at identifying fraudulent patterns and delineating those behaviors from legitimate customer activity.
Session Monitoring
Session monitoring uses similar techniques to identity fraud, but it monitors aspects of the user session, whether it’s banking, e-commerce, or any other use case. Each session is monitored individually for abnormal or suspicious behavior. This can both stop fraudulent transactions and help protect legitimate customers from fraudulent purchases or transfers as well as theft of payment details or rewards points.
Fraud monitoring can also be used to identify and stop malicious scripts. For example, a fraudster may write a script to automate the process of trying a combination of different passwords for an account. Session monitoring can stop this attack by blocking it outright, or requiring a CAPTCHA check or step-up identity verification.
In another example, session monitoring may detect fraud if the location or type of device changes during the course of the session. A payment initiated in one country but authorized in another would be considered high-risk behavior, for instance.
Additional examples of monitored session data can include the following:
- Typing speed
- Type of browser
- Operating system
- IP address
- Geolocation
Brand Monitoring
Cybercriminals often impersonate trusted brands in order to scam unsuspecting customers. Fraudsters use phishing emails, fraudulent mobile apps, and phony social media pages to hijack a brand’s identity and exploit brand reputation in attacks targeting customers and other consumers and businesses.
Fraud monitoring solutions designed to short-circuit this kind of “brandjacking” employ expert analysis and artificial intelligence to continuously scan the digital landscape for signs of brand impersonation in social media, app stores, and domain registrations and then work to shut them down.
What Happens When Fraud Is Detected?
Transaction & Account Fraud
Different actions and attributes of a login, transaction, or other activity contribute to its overall risk score. Based on an organization’s designated thresholds, a transaction can either be approved, blocked, or sent through a challenge flow depending on the score. Transactions deemed low risk are sent through a frictionless flow, meaning no additional steps or information is required to proceed.
With today’s most sophisticated solutions, challenge flows are initiated for only those rare logins or transactions that truly warrant additional scrutiny. Typically, these challenges require the user to provide additional identity information to complete the login or transaction. This could be a One Time Password (OTP) sent via text or email or even include biometric authentication via fingerprint scan. Challenge flows are only applied to risky transactions, keeping your customers safe and conversion rates high.
Brand Fraud
As soon as fraudulent sites, apps, or social media pages are identified, takedowns are immediately initiated, helping to mitigate cyberattacks before they cause serious harm to customers or to the brand. Brand monitoring providers work directly with platforms and registrars so organizations don’t have to expend the considerable amount of time or resources needed to do this themselves.
What to Look for in Fraud Monitoring Services
Not all fraud monitoring services are created equal. Here are some key features you’ll want to look out for when choosing a fraud monitoring service.
Machine Learning and Data Science Expertise
Leveraging machine learning is critical for modern fraud prevention. This method of detection identifies fraud based on behavior, rather than known attack attributes. For instance, signature-based detection relies on fingerprinting each fraudulent action, with each variation of fraud having its own unique ID. When an attack matches the rule set, it is blocked.
The problem with this method is that it creates massive rule sets that are easy for fraudsters to bypass. If cybercriminals introduce slight variations to their attacks, signature-based monitoring will fail to identify them.
As with all machine learning-based approaches, algorithms are only as good as the size and quality of the underlying dataset and the expertise of the data scientists who train them. As a result, it’s best to source solutions from providers with proven expertise in leveraging global, cross-industry intelligence to differentiate legitimate customers from criminal behavior in real time.
Take our own market-leading anti-fraud products for example. Outseer 3-D Secure builds upon the EMV® 3-D Secure payment standard to deliver unrivalled protection against card-not-present (CNP) fraud. And Outseer Fraud Manager detects and prevents fraud in every customer interaction—including logins, enrollments, in-session activities, and more.
Both are powered by advanced data science informed by shared transaction and identity data from more than 6,500 partners spanning every industry and geography to make faster, smarter risk decisions at every moment.
Frictionless Flow for a Faster, Safer Customer Experience
Stopping transaction fraud shouldn’t have to cost you conversions. Look for products that offer step-up verification with frictionless flow. This protects the customer experience by only requiring additional information for the scant few transactions, logins, or other activities that are truly high risk. Outseer solutions, for instance, prevent 95% of all fraud loss while reserving interventions for a mere 5% of all transactions. That’s the best performance in the industry.
Comprehensive Brand Protection
With phishing attacks on the rise, brand protection is vital to a comprehensive fraud monitoring strategy. Look for fraud monitoring products that offer continuous scanning, phishing protection, and automatic takedown services to protect your brand. Here again, we can help. Outseer FraudAction provides 24/7, all-inclusive threat management to protect your brand and your customers from phishing and malware, fraudulent mobile apps and bogus social media pages.
Seeing What Others Can’t to Protect & Grow Your Business
Mastering the nuances of risk-based fraud monitoring can be daunting for most companies. And building the kind of global, cross-industry data consortium needed to do it right is largely impossible on their own. That’s why major credit card companies, financial services firms, and payment processors source providers like Outseer to protect themselves and the businesses they serve.
Outseer delivers seamless fraud protection that defeats both fraud and user friction at the same time. Through machine learning, data science, and shared global intelligence, our products secure transactions—more than $100 billions worth in just the first half of 2021—and kneecap brand impersonations that threaten financial and reputational harm.

5 Key Payments Fraud Predictions for 2022 | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/fraud-predictions-2022,2021-12-15,"5 Key Payments Fraud Predictions for 2022
Worried about new fraud trends? Protect yourself against these payment fraud risks this upcoming year.
When it comes to digital payments, there are only two certainties about the year ahead. Transaction volumes will continue to grow. And so will the losses stemming from payments fraud.
Thanks to the rocket fuel provided by COVID-19, global ecommerce grew 16.8% to nearly $5 trillion in 2021, with no signs of slowing down. Even the most resistant among us have come to embrace card-not-present (CNP) transactions and payment options like Buy-Online-Pickup-in-Store (BOPIS) and Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL).
But there’s also plenty of risk. According to Aite-Novarica Group, CNP fraud topped $15.3 billion in 2021. Illicit transactions facilitated by account takeovers (ATOs) now lead to more than $16 billion in annual loss. As adoption of digital payments continues to climb, cybercriminals with adapt their attack methodologies to avoid detection and maximize profit. Here are five key trends to look for in 2022:
#1 ‘Buy-Now-Pay-Later’ Bubble Runs Risk of Bursting
Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services such as Afterpay, Klarna, and Sezzle achieved meteoric growth in 2021 as consumers racked up $100 billion in debt-driven purchases. That’s up from just $24 billion in 2020.
In the US, a third of all BNPL users have fallen behind on payments. Roughly 72% have seen a drop in their credit score. And despite being touted as a pennywise alternative to credit cards, analysts believe the people most drawn to BNPL are those with maxed out cards. Let’s just say the “Buy-Now-Pay-Never” memes are already flying fast.
It gets worse. Cybercriminals increasingly use stolen login credentials to infiltrate BNPL-enabled accounts and go on illicit shopping sprees at their victims’ expense. They’re also gaming the BNPL account enrollment process to defraud merchants and other organizations. Compromised and synthetic identity data used to apply for personal loans already contribute to annual loss of more than $57 billion.
As the industry enters 2022, anti-fraud solutions that employ machine learning, data science, and shared global intelligence could be crucial to preventing BNPL fraud and neutralizing calls for increased regulation.
#2 Deepfakes Do Real Damage
Phishing scams leveraging deepfake technology will bedevil organizations in 2022. In these attacks, fraudsters use audio synthesis technology to sample and manipulate the voices of corporate executives for use in social engineering campaigns targeting employees.
Context, timing, writing style, and voice idiosyncrasies are painstakingly mimicked. The result: highly personalized and extremely convincing messages capable of duping even the most vigilant employee.
Just within the last four months, cybercriminals leveraged forged emails and deepfake phone messages appearing to come from a corporate CEO to fool a branch manager into wiring $35 million to the perpetrators. In 2022, real-time deepfake technology may even reach the point where fraudsters can readily pull off live phone and video chats with their targets.
To defend against such rackets, businesses must prioritize high-quality fraud training. A single slide on cybersecurity won’t cut it anymore. Employees need to be updated regularly with examples of scams that accurately reflect the threat landscape.
#3 Touchless Transactions Crack the (QR) Code
In surveys, 60% of consumers claim they’d choose a business with contactless payment options like scan-and-go, pay-at-the-gate, and pay-at-the-table over a competitor that lacks them. But 2022 will also bring a Back-to-the-Future quality to many transactions as QR codes stage a comeback.
First introduced more than 30 years ago, these squiggly, black-and-white squares are actually 2-D barcodes that you scan with your smartphone to board airplanes, read menus, attend concerts, download coupons, dial up call centers, or make direct purchases.
Today’s QRenaissance will combine 2-D barcodes with facial recognition, voice printing, embedded biometrics and risk-based assessment to transparently authenticate customers behind the scenes. The most robust solutions on the market have been shown to prevent 95% of all fraud loss with a small 5% intervention rate.
According to Mastercard, the use of contactless payments options jumped 40% in 2021. Look for savvy retailers to follow Tesco and Amazon in expanding the use of QR codes, near-field communication (NFC), and other ambient payment technologies in order to deliver a compelling touchless customer experience.
#4 It Takes a Village to Tackle Payments Fraud
Cybercriminal groups have adopted many of the same technologies and organizational efficiencies as any other enterprise. They also nurture networks to sell, barter, and share stolen identity information, payment card numbers, and money mule accounts. A go-it-alone approach against this kind of collusion is ill advised.
In 2022, more banks, card issuers, merchants, telcos, healthcare companies, law enforcement agencies, and governments will form consortiums across industries and geographies to share fraud and transaction data, resources and insights that can help them detect and block cybercriminals.
In just the first half of 2021, our own global fraud and transaction data helped protect more than $100 billion in transactions while facilitating fast, frictionless transactions. And it’s a good thing, too. According to Forrester, the coming year will consumers show little forgiveness to companies that are unable to meet their expectations for speed, ease, and security.
#5 Cybercriminals Crash the Cryptocurrency Party
Today, there are more than 6,000 cryptocurrencies worldwide. With a growing number of merchants accepting them, cryptocurrency is expected to become the fourth most popular payment option by year’s end. That is, provided exchanges and wallet providers can keep crypto funds safe from intruders.
Blockchain’s reputation for impenetrability notwithstanding, cybercriminals armed with compromised login credentials can raid Internet-connected wallets just the same as any other account. And billions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrencies have been pilfered from exchanges via inventive phishing scams, brute-force attacks, and other tactics.
Exchanges and wallet providers are advised to deploy AI-based anti-fraud solutions along with cyberattack intelligence and takedown services to not just detect fraud, but also to shut down the phishing sites used attacks before they can do serious financial harm to customers.

Worried about new fraud trends? Protect yourself against these payment fraud risks this upcoming year.
When it comes to digital payments, there are only two certainties about the year ahead. Transaction volumes will continue to grow. And so will the losses stemming from payments fraud.
Thanks to the rocket fuel provided by COVID-19, global ecommerce grew 16.8% to nearly $5 trillion in 2021, with no signs of slowing down. Even the most resistant among us have come to embrace card-not-present (CNP) transactions and payment options like Buy-Online-Pickup-in-Store (BOPIS) and Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL).
But there’s also plenty of risk. According to Aite-Novarica Group, CNP fraud topped $15.3 billion in 2021. Illicit transactions facilitated by account takeovers (ATOs) now lead to more than $16 billion in annual loss. As adoption of digital payments continues to climb, cybercriminals with adapt their attack methodologies to avoid detection and maximize profit. Here are five key trends to look for in 2022:
#1 ‘Buy-Now-Pay-Later’ Bubble Runs Risk of Bursting
Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services such as Afterpay, Klarna, and Sezzle achieved meteoric growth in 2021 as consumers racked up $100 billion in debt-driven purchases. That’s up from just $24 billion in 2020.
In the US, a third of all BNPL users have fallen behind on payments. Roughly 72% have seen a drop in their credit score. And despite being touted as a pennywise alternative to credit cards, analysts believe the people most drawn to BNPL are those with maxed out cards. Let’s just say the “Buy-Now-Pay-Never” memes are already flying fast.
It gets worse. Cybercriminals increasingly use stolen login credentials to infiltrate BNPL-enabled accounts and go on illicit shopping sprees at their victims’ expense. They’re also gaming the BNPL account enrollment process to defraud merchants and other organizations. Compromised and synthetic identity data used to apply for personal loans already contribute to annual loss of more than $57 billion.
As the industry enters 2022, anti-fraud solutions that employ machine learning, data science, and shared global intelligence could be crucial to preventing BNPL fraud and neutralizing calls for increased regulation.
#2 Deepfakes Do Real Damage
Phishing scams leveraging deepfake technology will bedevil organizations in 2022. In these attacks, fraudsters use audio synthesis technology to sample and manipulate the voices of corporate executives for use in social engineering campaigns targeting employees.
Context, timing, writing style, and voice idiosyncrasies are painstakingly mimicked. The result: highly personalized and extremely convincing messages capable of duping even the most vigilant employee.
Just within the last four months, cybercriminals leveraged forged emails and deepfake phone messages appearing to come from a corporate CEO to fool a branch manager into wiring $35 million to the perpetrators. In 2022, real-time deepfake technology may even reach the point where fraudsters can readily pull off live phone and video chats with their targets.
To defend against such rackets, businesses must prioritize high-quality fraud training. A single slide on cybersecurity won’t cut it anymore. Employees need to be updated regularly with examples of scams that accurately reflect the threat landscape.
#3 Touchless Transactions Crack the (QR) Code
In surveys, 60% of consumers claim they’d choose a business with contactless payment options like scan-and-go, pay-at-the-gate, and pay-at-the-table over a competitor that lacks them. But 2022 will also bring a Back-to-the-Future quality to many transactions as QR codes stage a comeback.
First introduced more than 30 years ago, these squiggly, black-and-white squares are actually 2-D barcodes that you scan with your smartphone to board airplanes, read menus, attend concerts, download coupons, dial up call centers, or make direct purchases.
Today’s QRenaissance will combine 2-D barcodes with facial recognition, voice printing, embedded biometrics and risk-based assessment to transparently authenticate customers behind the scenes. The most robust solutions on the market have been shown to prevent 95% of all fraud loss with a small 5% intervention rate.
According to Mastercard, the use of contactless payments options jumped 40% in 2021. Look for savvy retailers to follow Tesco and Amazon in expanding the use of QR codes, near-field communication (NFC), and other ambient payment technologies in order to deliver a compelling touchless customer experience.
#4 It Takes a Village to Tackle Payments Fraud
Cybercriminal groups have adopted many of the same technologies and organizational efficiencies as any other enterprise. They also nurture networks to sell, barter, and share stolen identity information, payment card numbers, and money mule accounts. A go-it-alone approach against this kind of collusion is ill advised.
In 2022, more banks, card issuers, merchants, telcos, healthcare companies, law enforcement agencies, and governments will form consortiums across industries and geographies to share fraud and transaction data, resources and insights that can help them detect and block cybercriminals.
In just the first half of 2021, our own global fraud and transaction data helped protect more than $100 billion in transactions while facilitating fast, frictionless transactions. And it’s a good thing, too. According to Forrester, the coming year will consumers show little forgiveness to companies that are unable to meet their expectations for speed, ease, and security.
#5 Cybercriminals Crash the Cryptocurrency Party
Today, there are more than 6,000 cryptocurrencies worldwide. With a growing number of merchants accepting them, cryptocurrency is expected to become the fourth most popular payment option by year’s end. That is, provided exchanges and wallet providers can keep crypto funds safe from intruders.
Blockchain’s reputation for impenetrability notwithstanding, cybercriminals armed with compromised login credentials can raid Internet-connected wallets just the same as any other account.

Fraud Prevention is the New Brand Experience: The Secret to Secure, Friction-Free Digital Commerce
As we steamroll toward the all-important fourth quarter, it’s a good time to rethink fraud prevention in online commerce. More than $200 billion in revenue may be riding on it.
According to Jupiter Research, global digital commerce accounted for $4.2 trillion in revenues in 2020, and is expected to climb another 16.8% this year. Even as they slowly return to real-world stores, consumers continue to buy through card-not-present (CNP) transactions driven through mobile apps, text messaging, and popular online payment options like Buy-Online-Pickup-in-Store (BOPIS) and Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL).
Yet while all of this digital convenience is exciting, it’s also now simply expected. For merchants, the ability to tap customer data to deliver truly seamless, personalized, and differentiating digital brand experiences will grow more crucial by the day. But accomplishing that will take bulletproof fraud prevention measures that don’t frustrate the many to keep out a malicious few.
Fraud + Friction: The Ultimate Brand Busters
From the look of things, that’ll be easier said than done. As shopping and payments become more global, mobile, and on-demand, whole new avenues of attack have emerged for fraudsters to exploit.
Losses from CNP fraud alone, for instance, topped $6.4 billion in 2020—and could increase another 16.4% this year. Meanwhile, fraudsters are also capitalizing on windows of opportunity in payment options like BOPIS, which suffers a 7% fraud attempt rate compared to 4.6% with other delivery models. And the fact that customers receive goods before ever paying means BNPL could prove irresistible to organized fraud.
At the same time, brand impersonators continue to target consumers with phishing attacks, malicious shopping apps, and fraudulent social media pages to steal credit card information and login credentials. And account takeover (ATO) attacks now lead to more than $16 billion in loss in the U.S. alone, up 300% from 2019.
According to HelpNetSecurity, 26% of merchants say these forms of fraud are significantly damaging their profitability. But throttling up fraud controls means irksome step-up challenges and cart abandonment, and unwarranted transaction declines that erode revenue potential and send customers running to competitors. The good news: It doesn’t need to be this way.
Risk-based Authentication to the Rescue
Today, credit card companies, banks, and payment processors serving the retail sector are racing to layer in fraud defenses that don’t drive away customers. But they’re having only limited success. Steps like confirming CNP transactions with customers via text message is a growing trend, for instance. But shopping cart abandonment continues to impact 75% of all purchases, leading to $4 trillion in lost revenue potential each year.
Risk-based authentication (RBA) is proving to be a much better approach. Solutions that build upon the features available in the EMV 3-D Secure protocol and other technologies, for instance, analyze hundreds of risk indicators to silently authenticate customers before a transaction even happens—with zero friction for legitimate users. In real-world deployments, our own 3DS-based solution delivers a friction-free transaction experience while preventing 95% of all fraud loss. Only a scant 5% of transactions deemed high-risk are challenged.
Putting an End to Imposters and ATOs
Combined with other technologies, risk-based authentication can be used to prevent account takeover with the same efficacy. Using Outseer again as an example, we leverage identity science and crowdsourced intelligence from 20 billion annual transactions spanning every industry and geography to measure the risk associated with a user’s login and post-login activities. That includes transactions, changes to account details, and more.
Since users are authenticated transparently, step-up challenges are reserved for those very few instances requiring extra scrutiny—creating a smooth, seamless experience for authentic users while kicking fraudulent transactions to the curb.
Still, these measures may not always be enough on their own. Merchants themselves should source a threat management and takedown service that can protect against phishing attacks, rogue mobile apps, and fraudulent social media pages that target their customers and can do serious reputational damage to their brands. (You can learn more about Outseer’s threat monitoring and remediation services here.)
Safer Sales Are Just the Start of It
As a CMO, I understand what’s at stake in all of this—and it’s bigger than just fourth quarter revenue and profit.
Increased digital transactions have bathed merchants in consumer data. This does more than just help them make the contextually relevant offers that can increase cart value by 40%. As The Drum points out, it also makes retail brands powerful media platforms in their own right—just ask Amazon and its $6.9 billion in first-quarter ad revenue.
With Google signaling the end of third-party cookies and Apple’s moves to block ad targeting, the first-party data merchants collect and the direct consumer channels they control can be monetized as advertising venues that further boost their profits this holiday season and (far) beyond.
But that’s only if they can create the safe, secure digital shopping experience consumers (and brand partners) expect. Risk-based transaction fraud controls and other anti-fraud solutions will be critical to making that happen.

Fraud Detection: How It Works & Why It’s Needed
Are you looking for information on Fraud Detection? We explain the different types of fraudulent activities, fraud detection methods, and the benefits of fraud detection.
What Is Fraud Detection?
Fraud detection is the process of recognizing unauthorized activities where money or property is obtained through false pretenses, such as phishing, stolen credit cards, and identity theft. Fraud detection relies on machine learning and data analytics to identify these malicious transactions.
Why Fraud Detection Matters
Most forms of financial fraud involve impersonation or identity fraud. According to a recent study by Javelin Strategy, losses stemming from identity fraud totaled $56 billion in 2020 and has shown no signs of slowing down. As more businesses utilize digital channels to serve their customers, fraudsters work tirelessly to find ways to exploit them.
With the advent of Crimeware-as-a-Service (CaaS), digital fraud is now easier to execute than ever before. The CaaS model puts spyware and fraud tools into the hands of average criminals, making cyber fraud accessible to anyone, even those who lack technical know-how. CaaS offerings can include spyware attacks, phishing toolkits, money mule services, and more. In many cases, the cybercriminals behind the offerings collect a percentage of funds extracted from victims, or in the case of money mule accounts, up to 60% of the amount deposited.
Machine Learning vs. Signature-based Protection
Not all fraud detection systems are created equal. Before machine learning, signature-based mechanisms would store known threats inside a database. If the system detected activity that matched a signature, it was blocked. Bad actors quickly caught on and introduced randomness to their attack methodologies to avoid signature detection.
Machine learning works by detecting behavioral patterns and stopping threats before they can cause harm. Rather than looking only at the composition of a transaction, machine learning looks at the context for, and the relationships behind, a transaction to identify fraudulent behavior. This can include variables such as the type of payment being made, whether the payee account has received payment from the user in the past, is the amount characteristic of the user’s payment, and so on.
How Fraud Detection Works
Fraud detection leverages machine learning, statistical analysis, and behavior monitoring to identify the patterns and strategies used by criminals to commit fraud. When precursors to fraud are identified, the system can stop fraudulent activity before any damage occurs.
For fraud detection to work, the system must first study instances of known fraud. Let’s review some of the most common fraud detection learning models.
Supervised Classifications
Supervised learning works by training an algorithm to detect fraud based on historical data. The training uses existing datasets with pre-marked variables. Using this past data, researchers can measure how well an algorithm performs at detecting fraud.
Supervised learning allows researchers to control what the fraud detection system learns and provides a simple framework for testing and debugging the machine learning process.
Unsupervised Classifications
Unsupervised learning sorts unlabeled data into clusters based on the relationship each data point has with one another. Hidden relationships can often be discovered, identifying precursors to fraudulent activities.
This methodology eliminates the need for data to be labeled, which can be time-consuming and expensive. The drawback is that the algorithm may learn unnecessary patterns in the process that don’t help detect fraud.
Different analytic models can be used to identify the predictors of fraud based on the past actions of criminals through statistical analysis. With this data, fraud prevention systems can assign certain behaviors a risk score.
Technologies such as the Outseer Risk Engine, for instance, assesses more than 100 different data intelligence indicators to evaluate the relative risk associated with a transaction. It then generates a risk score based on device and behavioral profiling enriched with intelligence from the Outseer Global Data Network, a consortium of shared identity and transaction data spanning 6,000 companies in every industry and geography.
By these and other data inputs, the Outseer Risk Engine uses an advanced statistical approach to calculating a risk score. This method infers the conditional probability of an event being fraudulent, given the known factors or predictors. All available factors are taken into consideration, weighted according to relevance. The most predictive factors count more heavily toward the score.
This approach has significant benefits over other machine learning models used for fraud detection today, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), as well as their more advanced counterparts, deep neural nets, or DNNs. As the foundational technologies for our fraud detection solutions, the risk scores generated by the Outseer Risk Engine have been shown to prevent 95% of all fraud loss, while interrupting only 5% of all transactions—the best performance in the industry. To learn more, download our Risk Engine white paper.
Fraud Scenarios
With fraud attempts on the rise, let’s review a few of the most common types of fraud and how AI-powered fraud detection can stop them.
Payment Fraud
Malicious actors see online shopping as the perfect place to test stolen credit card information—unprotected gateways without fraud protection experience more fraudulent purchases, resulting in higher chargebacks and loss of revenue.
Payment fraud detection platforms like Outseer 3-D Secure stop credit card fraud by identifying abnormalities in purchasing behavior. This analysis works in tandem with a global network of identity and threat intelligence assets that continuously feed the system with real-time information.
Account Takeover
With the dark web awash with compromised login credentials, account takeover surged 72% in 2020, according to Javelin. In these attacks, fraudsters use those stolen credentials to access legitimate user accounts. Once inside, the criminal impersonates the legitimate user and commits fraud under their identity. The online black market contains millions of stolen credentials, so how do you differentiate a real user from a fraudster?
Once again using Outseer as an example, we use predictive analytics and identity science to automatically sound the alarm on compromised accounts and take proactive steps to stop intruders from accessing company resources or initiating fraudulent transactions. Our fraud detection solutions can even detect insider threats and be paired with automatic remediation to stop attacks immediately.
Phishing & Brand Abuse
Cybercriminals disguise themselves as trusted individuals to trick recipients into sending money or revealing payment details, login credentials, or other private information. According to the FBI, phishing-based brand impersonation is the primary driver behind more than half of all cybercrime losses. And that’s before rogue mobile apps and fraudulent social media pages are taken into account.
Fraud detection solutions such as Outseer FraudAction continuously scan the threat landscape 24/7 to identify and take down sites used to distribute phishing attacks and malware, as well as rogue mobile apps, and social media pages impersonating your brand and targeting your customers and prospects.
How to Report Fraud
In the United States, different types of fraud are reported and investigated by multiple organizations. If you’re the victim of fraudulent activity, you can report it on the Department of Justice’s fraud report page. Alternatively, you can contact the Federal Bureau of Investigations to report corporate, financial, and investment fraud.
The Outseer Solution

Fraud Detection: How It Works & Why It’s Needed
Are you looking for information on Fraud Detection? We explain the different types of fraudulent activities, fraud detection methods, and the benefits of fraud detection.
What Is Fraud Detection?
Fraud detection is the process of recognizing unauthorized activities where money or property is obtained through false pretenses, such as phishing, stolen credit cards, and identity theft. Fraud detection relies on machine learning and data analytics to identify these malicious transactions.
Why Fraud Detection Matters
Most forms of financial fraud involve impersonation or identity fraud. According to a recent study by Javelin Strategy, losses stemming from identity fraud totaled $56 billion in 2020 and has shown no signs of slowing down. As more businesses utilize digital channels to serve their customers, fraudsters work tirelessly to find ways to exploit them.
With the advent of Crimeware-as-a-Service (CaaS), digital fraud is now easier to execute than ever before. The CaaS model puts spyware and fraud tools into the hands of average criminals, making cyber fraud accessible to anyone, even those who lack technical know-how. CaaS offerings can include spyware attacks, phishing toolkits, money mule services, and more. In many cases, the cybercriminals behind the offerings collect a percentage of funds extracted from victims, or in the case of money mule accounts, up to 60% of the amount deposited.
Machine Learning vs. Signature-based Protection
Not all fraud detection systems are created equal. Before machine learning, signature-based mechanisms would store known threats inside a database. If the system detected activity that matched a signature, it was blocked. Bad actors quickly caught on and introduced randomness to their attack methodologies to avoid signature detection.
Machine learning works by detecting behavioral patterns and stopping threats before they can cause harm. Rather than looking only at the composition of a transaction, machine learning looks at the context for, and the relationships behind, a transaction to identify fraudulent behavior. This can include variables such as the type of payment being made, whether the payee account has received payment from the user in the past, is the amount characteristic of the user’s payment, and so on.
How Fraud Detection Works
Fraud detection leverages machine learning, statistical analysis, and behavior monitoring to identify the patterns and strategies used by criminals to commit fraud. When precursors to fraud are identified, the system can stop fraudulent activity before any damage occurs.
For fraud detection to work, the system must first study instances of known fraud. Let’s review some of the most common fraud detection learning models.
Supervised Classifications
Supervised learning works by training an algorithm to detect fraud based on historical data. The training uses existing datasets with pre-marked variables. Using this past data, researchers can measure how well an algorithm performs at detecting fraud.
Supervised learning allows researchers to control what the fraud detection system learns and provides a simple framework for testing and debugging the machine learning process.
Unsupervised Classifications
Unsupervised learning sorts unlabeled data into clusters based on the relationship each data point has with one another. Hidden relationships can often be discovered, identifying precursors to fraudulent activities.
This methodology eliminates the need for data to be labeled, which can be time-consuming and expensive. The drawback is that the algorithm may learn unnecessary patterns in the process that don’t help detect fraud.
Different analytic models can be used to identify the predictors of fraud based on the past actions of criminals through statistical analysis. With this data, fraud prevention systems can assign certain behaviors a risk score.
Technologies such as the Outseer Risk Engine, for instance, assesses more than 100 different data intelligence indicators to evaluate the relative risk associated with a transaction. It then generates a risk score based on device and behavioral profiling enriched with intelligence from the Outseer Global Data Network, a consortium of shared identity and transaction data spanning 6,000 companies in every industry and geography.
By these and other data inputs, the Outseer Risk Engine uses an advanced statistical approach to calculating a risk score. This method infers the conditional probability of an event being fraudulent, given the known factors or predictors. All available factors are taken into consideration, weighted according to relevance. The most predictive factors count more heavily toward the score.
This approach has significant benefits over other machine learning models used for fraud detection today, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), as well as their more advanced counterparts, deep neural nets, or DNNs. As the foundational technologies for our fraud detection solutions, the risk scores generated by the Outseer Risk Engine have been shown to prevent 95% of all fraud loss, while interrupting only 5% of all transactions—the best performance in the industry.

Fraud Scenarios
With fraud attempts on the rise, let’s review a few of the most common types of fraud and how AI-powered fraud detection can stop them.
Payment Fraud
Malicious actors see online shopping as the perfect place to test stolen credit card information—unprotected gateways without fraud protection experience more fraudulent purchases, resulting in higher chargebacks and loss of revenue.
Payment fraud detection platforms like Outseer 3-D Secure stop credit card fraud by identifying abnormalities in purchasing behavior. This analysis works in tandem with a global network of identity and threat intelligence assets that continuously feed the system with real-time information.
Account Takeover
With the dark web awash with compromised login credentials, account takeover surged 72% in 2020, according to Javelin. In these attacks, fraudsters use those stolen credentials to access legitimate user accounts. Once inside, the criminal impersonates the legitimate user and commits fraud under their identity. The online black market contains millions of stolen credentials, so how do you differentiate a real user from a fraudster?
Once again using Outseer as an example, we use predictive analytics and identity science to automatically sound the alarm on compromised accounts and take proactive steps to stop intruders from accessing company resources or initiating fraudulent transactions. Our fraud detection solutions can even detect insider threats and be paired with automatic remediation to stop attacks immediately.
Phishing & Brand Abuse
Cybercriminals disguise themselves as trusted individuals to trick recipients into sending money or revealing payment details, login credentials, or other private information. According to the FBI, phishing-based brand impersonation is the primary driver behind more than half of all cybercrime losses. And that’s before rogue mobile apps and fraudulent social media pages are taken into account.
Fraud detection solutions such as Outseer FraudAction continuously scan the threat landscape 24/7 to identify and take down sites used to distribute phishing attacks and malware, as well as rogue mobile apps, and social media pages impersonating your brand and targeting your customers and prospects.
How to Report Fraud
In the United States, different types of fraud are reported and investigated by multiple organizations. If you’re the victim of fraudulent activity, you can report it on the Department of Justice’s fraud report page. Alternatively, you can contact the Federal Bureau of Investigations to report corporate, financial, and investment fraud.

Fraud Prevention: Best Tips & Tools for Your Company
Curious about fraud prevention? We discuss common fraudulent activity and give a complete explanation of how fraud prevention keeps fraudsters from succeeding.
What Is Fraud Prevention?
Fraud prevention is the strategy of detecting attempted fraudulent activity as it happens. With real-time monitoring and machine learning techniques, companies can stop fraudulent transactions before they occur.
Benefits of Fraud Prevention
Fraud can manifest in many ways, from fraudulent payments to brand impersonation, and it can be overwhelming to identify these attacks—let alone stop them. A fraud protection system identifies, classifies, and prevents fraud in all of its forms.
Fraud protection does more than just prevent financial loss: It builds confidence throughout an organization. It also helps shareholders rest easy knowing their investment is safe; many fraud protection systems feature auditing to demonstrate compliance and proactiveness against fraud.
Beyond financial loss, fraud can erode customer trust. Impersonation attacks launched through phishing scams, rogue apps, or fraudulent social media pages can do serious reputational damage. Leveraging fraud protection can help keep customer trust intact by protecting customer’s data and transactions.
How Fraud Prevention Works
In the past, fraud protection was a cumbersome process that required investigators to comb over transactions one by one to identify fraud and then take measures to stop it from happening again. As a result, fraud teams are stuck perpetually fighting yesterday’s war, tackling known threats while those not yet recognized wreak havoc.
But today, machine learning is changing all that. By leveraging device, contextual and relationship data, it’s possible to create models of what fraudulent activity looks like rather than fingerprinting every threat. These models are then used in authentication processes that factor in thousands of data points to distinguish criminal activity from legitimate transactions.
Many fraud protection systems then generate a risk score associated with a given transaction so that organizations can strike the right balance between fraud prevention and user experience.
Fraud Prevention in Action
Phishing
Phishing attacks mimic trusted brands to commit fraud and spread malware. Consumers lost at least $43 billion last year through robocalls, text, and email scams that led to the theft of login credentials or payment fraud, according to the 2021 Identity Fraud Study from Javelin Strategy and Research. And the FBI reports that businesses lost another $55 billion through phishing and business email compromise (BEC) scams.
Outseer FraudAction provides 24/7 fraud protection across all channels by working to take down phishing sites, fraudulent social media accounts, and rogue mobile apps used in these attacks—before they cause harm to your customers.
CNP Payment Fraud
Card Not Present (CNP) fraud occurs when stolen credit card information is used to make a purchase. Requiring the three-digit CW security code can help prevent this, but only if the security code wasn’t also stolen.
Outseer 3-D Secure secures transactions by using behavioral analysis combined with insights from a global network of identity and transaction data. These tools allow you to reduce chargebacks and provide an uninterrupted shopping experience to legitimate customers.
Account Takeover
How do you distinguish a real user from an intruder? With so many stolen credentials online it can seem impossible to tell the difference. Fraud protection systems can tell the difference by analyzing the behavior of each account to discover abnormalities that signal fraud.
Outseer Fraud Manager uses data science and machine learning to defeat fraudulent account access across all channels. We take the complexity out of fraud protection through our complete ecosystem approach and out-of-the-box authentication and step-up options.
Fraud Prevention Challenges
The business of preventing fraud can be enormously complex, so it’s not surprising that we’re seeing a steady rise in the number of businesses choosing managed-service fraud prevention over on-premise solutions.
The first step in fraud protection is fraud detection. This involves baselining user transaction behavior, building and optimizing statistical models, and aggregating the resulting threat intelligence. These tasks require skilled data scientists and access to machine-learning platforms.
Once fraudulent activity is discovered, its risk needs to be classified. Misclassification of fraud can leave systems vulnerable and produce erroneous audits and reports. Risk classification requires a combination of industry knowledge and data science expertise to properly implement.
Lastly, fraud prevention solutions must work seamlessly without impacting the customer experience. Machine learning algorithms must be thoughtfully trained to identify new threats while engineers build and continuously refine the management front-end. Many organizations simply lack the expertise, funding, or access to intelligence networks to build this kind of anti-fraud platform on their own.

Fraud Risk Assessment: What Is It & Why Do I Need One? | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/fraud-risk-assessment,2022-03-15,"Fraud Risk Assessment: What Is It & Why Do I Need One?
We discuss what a fraud risk assessment is and how it helps organizations detect vulnerabilities and proactively protect themselves from fraudulent transactions and activities.
What Is a Fraud Risk Assessment?
A fraud risk assessment is a process for identifying an organization’s exposure to fraud and developing a plan to mitigate that risk before it does financial, reputational, or legal damage.
These assessments help companies understand their vulnerabilities so they can deploy countermeasures that align with their business objectives and protect against the growing scourge of fraud.
According to The Economist, new technologies have enabled cybercrime at an industrial scale.
Last year, fraud losses in the U.S. surged 70% over levels seen in 2020, according to the Federal Trade Commission. As much as 50% of digital fraud can be traced back to organized crime rings that can show a level of sophistication that requires expertise in AI-enabled analytics, automation and all the capabilities of any modern enterprise.
Card-not-present fraud alone may top $408.5 billion in annual losses worldwide by 2030. Account takeover (ATO) fueled by data breaches increased 850% between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021. And account enrollment involving synthetic identities are already a $6 billion problem the FBI calls one of the fast-growing financial crimes. Only 5% to 15% of the perpetrators are every caught.
Increasingly supported by nation-states, fraud is increasingly linked to global crime rings, human traffickers, and terrorist groups.
In a rapidly-evolving threat environment like this, ongoing fraud risk assessments may be crucial to uncovering exposure to evolving fraud risks to protect businesses from significant financial loss and data theft.
How Does a Fraud Risk Assessment Work?
Fraud risk assessments are tailored for an organization’s industry, risk tolerance, and overall operational needs. The assessment is typically performed by the heads of each department or by an outside auditor.
Each manager conducts their own assessment within their department, highlighting different aspects of fraud risk. There are multiple components to these reports, which should all include the following:
- Descriptions of fraud risk: Details where the fraud takes place, who is involved, and how it can happen.
- Responsible party: The person in charge of implementing anti-fraud and risk mitigation efforts.
- Significance to the organization: Outlines the consequences of fraud for this system, including potential data and financial loss and how it impacts the organization overall.
- Likelihood of occurrence: The frequency of each type of fraud.
- Existing anti-fraud measures: Records and documents any anti-fraud measures in place and how those tools detect or prevent fraud attempts.
- Ongoing monitoring actions: Establishes monitoring activities by type and schedule.
Once this information has been collected, managers from all departments typically report their findings to their board of directors. This allows the organization to design preventive measures and deploy defensive controls based on likelihood, significance, and risk tolerance.
What Should a Fraud Risk Assessment Cover?
Fraud risk assessment should cover four key areas:
- Regulatory Compliance
- Financial and Non-Financial Reporting
- Asset Misappropriation
- Illegal Acts
Let’s explore each area in a bit more detail.
Regulatory Compliance
Auditors should examine how well an organization complies with its industry’s regulatory standards. This should not only examine if compliance is being met, but also how thoroughly staff is at performing their duties.
Organizations will often verify their compliance through self-assessments. Examine the accuracy of these assessments to ensure that auditing tools are working properly and that employees are making a genuine effort to meet standards.
Financial and Non-Financial Reporting
Auditors should look for inconsistencies that could indicate fraud and then verify claims of revenue, profits, and expenses. This fraud typically happens at the management level where numbers are tweaked to understate losses and liabilities while exaggerating profits and performance.
Non-financial indicators can also be misrepresented to make organizations seem larger or to hide embezzlement activity. Non-financial indicators can include a number of customer accounts, leads generated, and employees hired.
Asset Misappropriation
Company equipment, lines of credit, inventory, and cash can all fall prey to misappropriation. This can range from outright theft and embezzlement to employees using company assets for personal use.
Auditors should look for signs of missing equipment and inventory as well as inconsistencies across financial records and accounts.
Illegal Acts
Illegal acts cover any type of fraud not described above. This can include data theft via spyware or other illegal activity that puts the company at risk. It’s important for auditors to be able to read between the lines and identify the indicators of fraud.
How to Conduct a Fraud Risk Assessment
The time it takes to conduct a fraud risk assessment will vary depending on your organization’s size and how many auditors you have in place. Typically, organizations conduct fraud risk assessments semiannually or when large changes occur across systems, departments, or processes.
Below are five steps you can take to conduct your own fraud risk assessment:
- Identify and Document Risks
Work to uncover both internal and external fraud risks across the organization. It’s best to work with the heads of each department as they have a deep knowledge of their department’s processes, tools, and habits.
Internal risks can include the following:
- Mismanagement of funds
- Employees failing to perform proper compliance self-assessments
- Misuse of company equipment and inventory
- Improper record keeping
External risks can include the following:
- Failing to scan for fraud among your customer base
- A lack of account takeover protection
- The inability to detect and prevent fraudulent purchases
- Unsecure systems that are vulnerable to cyberattack
- Weigh Risks by Probability and Severity
Weigh your risk based on the likelihood of occurrence and potential impact on your organization. Spreadsheets can help keep data organized as you quantify your results. A probability and severity matrix can help your team organize risks and prioritize them quickly.
When calculating the likelihood of a risk, consider how many times the risk can occur and how pervasive it is across your company. When measuring impact examine the financial losses that can occur, as well as the consequences from civil, criminal, and regulatory liabilities.
- Mitigate and Resolve
Once a prioritized list of risks has been created, it’s time to take action. Decide what actions are needed and who will be responsible for carrying them out. Each organization will have its own unique level of risk tolerance that balances cost and assumed risks.
In some cases, risk can be avoided altogether by stopping a service or terminating a high risk or reward program. In other cases, risk can be mitigated by improving policies and procedures and establishing checks and balances.
Fraud prevention systems can speed up data collection during a risk assessment and proactively perform risk mitigation and resolutions across an organization. These systems work by continuously monitoring user behavior and comparing that activity against known models of fraud.
- Monitor and Review
Fraud is continuously evolving to become less detectable and more impactful. Monitor your changes and perform a fraud investigation if you suspect fraud is adapting to your changes. Continuous monitoring helps not only spot new areas that need improvement but also uncover patterns that root out bigger problems within your organization.
- Report Risks
Report your findings objectively and identify a clear path between your risks and mitigation actions. Many times each department will come forward with its own fraud risk assessment. This data can be centralized into a single report to get an holistic view of an organization’s risk.

In a rapidly-evolving threat environment like this, ongoing fraud risk assessments may be crucial to uncovering exposure to evolving fraud risks to protect businesses from significant financial loss and data theft.
How Does a Fraud Risk Assessment Work?
Fraud risk assessments are tailored for an organization’s industry, risk tolerance, and overall operational needs. The assessment is typically performed by the heads of each department or by an outside auditor.
Each manager conducts their own assessment within their department, highlighting different aspects of fraud risk. There are multiple components to these reports, which should all include the following:
- Descriptions of fraud risk: Details where the fraud takes place, who is involved, and how it can happen.
- Responsible party: The person in charge of implementing anti-fraud and risk mitigation efforts.
- Significance to the organization: Outlines the consequences of fraud for this system, including potential data and financial loss and how it impacts the organization overall.
- Likelihood of occurrence: The frequency of each type of fraud.
- Existing anti-fraud measures: Records and documents any anti-fraud measures in place and how those tools detect or prevent fraud attempts.
- Ongoing monitoring actions: Establishes monitoring activities by type and schedule.
Once this information has been collected, managers from all departments typically report their findings to their board of directors. This allows the organization to design preventive measures and deploy defensive controls based on likelihood, significance, and risk tolerance.
What Should a Fraud Risk Assessment Cover?
Fraud risk assessment should cover four key areas:
- Regulatory Compliance
- Financial and Non-Financial Reporting
- Asset Misappropriation
- Illegal Acts
Let’s explore each area in a bit more detail.
Regulatory Compliance
Auditors should examine how well an organization complies with its industry’s regulatory standards. This should not only examine if compliance is being met, but also how thoroughly staff is at performing their duties.
Organizations will often verify their compliance through self-assessments. Examine the accuracy of these assessments to ensure that auditing tools are working properly and that employees are making a genuine effort to meet standards.
Financial and Non-Financial Reporting
Auditors should look for inconsistencies that could indicate fraud and then verify claims of revenue, profits, and expenses. This fraud typically happens at the management level where numbers are tweaked to understate losses and liabilities while exaggerating profits and performance.
Non-financial indicators can also be misrepresented to make organizations seem larger or to hide embezzlement activity. Non-financial indicators can include a number of customer accounts, leads generated, and employees hired.
Asset Misappropriation
Company equipment, lines of credit, inventory, and cash can all fall prey to misappropriation. This can range from outright theft and embezzlement to employees using company assets for personal use.
Auditors should look for signs of missing equipment and inventory as well as inconsistencies across financial records and accounts.
Illegal Acts
Illegal acts cover any type of fraud not described above. This can include data theft via spyware or other illegal activity that puts the company at risk. It’s important for auditors to be able to read between the lines and identify the indicators of fraud.
How to Conduct a Fraud Risk Assessment
The time it takes to conduct a fraud risk assessment will vary depending on your organization’s size and how many auditors you have in place. Typically, organizations conduct fraud risk assessments semiannually or when large changes occur across systems, departments, or processes.
Below are five steps you can take to conduct your own fraud risk assessment:
- Identify and Document Risks
Work to uncover both internal and external fraud risks across the organization. It’s best to work with the heads of each department as they have a deep knowledge of their department’s processes, tools, and habits.
Internal risks can include the following:
- Mismanagement of funds
- Employees failing to perform proper compliance self-assessments
- Misuse of company equipment and inventory
- Improper record keeping
External risks can include the following:
- Failing to scan for fraud among your customer base
- A lack of account takeover protection
- The inability to detect and prevent fraudulent purchases
- Unsecure systems that are vulnerable to cyberattack
- Weigh Risks by Probability and Severity
Weigh your risk based on the likelihood of occurrence and potential impact on your organization. Spreadsheets can help keep data organized as you quantify your results. A probability and severity matrix can help your team organize risks and prioritize them quickly.
When calculating the likelihood of a risk, consider how many times the risk can occur and how pervasive it is across your company. When measuring impact examine the financial losses that can occur, as well as the consequences from civil, criminal, and regulatory liabilities.
- Mitigate and Resolve
Once a prioritized list of risks has been created, it’s time to take action. Decide what actions are needed and who will be responsible for carrying them out. Each organization will have its own unique level of risk tolerance that balances cost and assumed risks.
In some cases, risk can be avoided altogether by stopping a service or terminating a high risk or reward program. In other cases, risk can be mitigated by improving policies and procedures and establishing checks and balances.
Fraud prevention systems can speed up data collection during a risk assessment and proactively perform risk mitigation and resolutions across an organization. These systems work by continuously monitoring user behavior and comparing that activity against known models of fraud.
- Monitor and Review
Fraud is continuously evolving to become less detectable and more impactful. Monitor your changes and perform a fraud investigation if you suspect fraud is adapting to your changes. Continuous monitoring helps not only spot new areas that need improvement but also uncover patterns that root out bigger problems within your organization.
- Report Risks
Report your findings objectively and identify a clear path between your risks and mitigation actions. Many times each department will come forward with its own fraud risk assessment. This data can be centralized into a single report to get an holistic view of an organization’s risk.

Fraudsters are looking to Capitalize on the Mounting International Tensions | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/fraudsters-to-capitalize-on-international-tensions,2022-05-21,"Fraudsters are looking to Capitalize on the Mounting International Tensions
CyberNews interviewed Outseer’s CMO + Chief Identity Officer Armen Najarian about the link between rising international tensions and increased scammer activity.
Global unrest is an excellent opportunity for cybercriminals to exploit businesses, creating a need for more protection measures from fraudsters.
Many people are familiar with the urgent emails in their spam folders – one of the most popular fraud methods. While some easily identify and ignore it, urgency makes others do actions without putting much thought into it. This can put the whole company at risk.
When falling victim to a fraudster’s hands, a password manager or a VPN service will not be enough to protect you. Such data theft prevention requires awareness and advanced fraud protection and prevention tools.
Armen Najarian, the CMO and Chief Identity Officer at Outseer – a company that specializes in fighting fraud, agreed to discuss such cyberattacks and their prevention methods.
Let’s go back to the very beginning of Outseer. What was your journey like throughout the years?
RSA, a leading cybersecurity solution, launched Outseer in June 2021 to authenticate identities, protect users, and prevent fraud. We offer a full suite of anti-fraud and threat intelligence services. By utilizing science, data, and expertise, Outseer focuses on delivering superior customer experiences and comprehensive risk management. In a short time, we have been able to provide security solutions that result in fewer false positives, happier customers, and lower operational costs with no compromise in quality.
As for my fraud prevention and cybersecurity journey, I began my career in this space as Chief Marketing Officer at ThreatMetrix. A couple of years later, I took on the role of Chief Marketing and Identity Officer at Agari where I was able to gain some real first-hand experience with how these criminal rings operate. During my time at Agari, my team and I discovered a Nigerian fraud group called Scattered Canary, which was filing fraudulent unemployment claims, receiving benefits from multiple states, and receiving payoffs.
Ultimately, this experience is what drew me into the role at Outseer. I understand the important work our team is doing with fraud protection and monitoring as more and more transactions take place online. Since I started at Outseer, our mission has always been to provide reliable foresight on identity authentication and fraud prevention.
Can you tell us a little bit about what you do? What are the main issues you help solve?
Outseer focuses on monitoring the fraud landscape to stay on top of the latest methods being deployed by cybercriminals. Some different types of fraud we look for include rogue mobile apps, phishing, impersonation, and brand abuse. We also work with companies to authenticate customer identities to ensure a person is using legitimate payment credentials that belong to them to purchase goods and services.
We offer a selection of solutions for companies to help combat various types of fraud. Our current offerings include Outseer 3-D Secure, Outseer Fraud Manager, Outseer FraudAction, and Outseer Emerging Payments. Each targets a different kind of protection, allowing companies to take a holistic approach to their network security and fraud prevention.
What technology do you use to secure payments without compromising the user experience?
Outseer uses 3-D Secure to help companies protect customers’ information during online transactions while providing a smooth customer experience. 3-D Secure authenticates users’ identities and protects their information, which increases transaction approvals, making the payments process faster, seamless, and more efficient. Additionally, user identities are verified at various points during transactions making it more accurate. 3D Secure protects various forms of payment, from traditional credit cards to newer methods like CNP and BNPL.
Outseer Fraud Manager monitors digital transactions to detect fraud, assess users’ risk factors, and deliver fraud detection trends. In addition, Fraud Manager warns users of potential fraud situations before they happen.
Outseer Fraud Action is an around-the-clock fraud and cybersecurity monitoring service that stops cyberattacks and detects fraudulent activity. Specifically, Fraud Action protects businesses from phishing attacks, malware, rogue mobile apps, impersonators, and fake social media accounts.
Outseer’s newest addition, Outseer Emerging Payments, was launched to combat fraud for new payment technologies. Buy Now, Pay Later Installments is the first solution offered under this product line.
Did you notice any new fraud techniques arise as a result of the recent global events?
The evolving Russia/Ukraine conflict has drastically influenced the fraud landscape, forcing companies to develop new techniques to combat cybersecurity challenges. From increased phishing and cybersecurity attacks to fake fundraising and hacking attempts, fraudsters are looking to capitalize on the mounting international tensions.
The global conflict wasn’t the only factor contributing to a rise in new fraud techniques. With the pandemic also came a wave of touchless technology and payments – one being QR codes. Many restaurants started using QR codes to encourage touchless interactions, but like any card-not-present transaction, there is an opportunity for fraud. Scanning QR codes for menus and payments opens up a new avenue for fraudsters to access private information. It’s hard to verify if a QR code is legit or if a fraudster replaced it to misdirect and scam customers.
Another factor is the significant influx of new payment technologies that have hit the market. An example is the “buy now pay later” (BNPL) trend that is currently taking the payment world by storm. Since BNPL transactions are still relatively new and there are multiple parties involved, there is an increased opportunity for fraudsters to take advantage of consumers’ vulnerabilities.
At Outseer, we work on staying on top of these global trends to combat these new forms of fraud while educating users about these risks.
What red flags indicate that a user might be malicious or someone is impersonating them?
Impersonators, fraudsters, and other malicious users are becoming more and more sophisticated in their approach to stealing consumers’ information and creating false accounts. Unfortunately, this makes it harder for people to recognize the signs that they are being scammed.
A common method bad actors use to trick people and collect personal information is impersonating someone close to you. You can prevent yourself from falling victim to this scam by keeping an eye out for these warning signs:
- Different Communication Methods. If the person contacting you usually uses a particular form of communication (i.e. text) but is reaching out via a different one (i.e. email), that is a red flag.
- Unknown Number. If a person is reaching out with a ‘new number,’ be sure to always take it with a grain of salt. A great way to authenticate their identity in this case is to get them on a phone call and see if you recognize their voice.
- Highly Urgent Requests. If you receive a suspicious email or text that says it requires immediate action (i.e. I need this money by today…), be sure to take a step back and really assess the situation. Fraudsters often try to rush victims into making rash decisions so they don’t feel like they have time to think it through.
Overall, use your best judgment. If there are any alarm bells going off in your head, there is often a good reason – be sure to always take a step back and investigate.
What cybersecurity risks do you think new business owners often fail to take into account?
Business owners often fail to consider the risks they are putting themselves and customers at when collecting and storing sensitive personal and financial information online. Cybersecurity and fraud prevention should be considered from the start and baked into the foundation of their network. It’s essential that they invest in security options that will protect their information as well as customers.
It’s also important to note that securing your network is an ever-evolving process, not a one-time investment. In order to have effective cybersecurity, businesses have to remain committed to updating their systems to ensure the network is able to defend against fraudsters’ new methods and techniques.
In your opinion, which organizations are attractive targets for fraudsters and should implement proper security measures as soon as possible?
Any organization that collects any amount of users’ personal information could be a target for fraudsters. Fraudsters can use as little as an email to commit fraudulent acts or build your profile on the dark web.
State databases are one of the hottest targets for fraudsters since they often hold a plethora of people’s sensitive information and are often on outdated servers. Most times, these databases are behind on security updates and modern technology, exposing them to vulnerabilities that hackers can (and will) take advantage of.
In general, all organizations that collect any sort of information from customers need to make sure they are investing in and implementing the proper security measures as soon as possible, for their and users’ protection.
Talking about average Internet users, what measures and practices do you think everyone should adopt to protect their identity online?
As the digital world continues to grow, more and more sensitive information is being stored online. With the majority of transactions taking place digitally, it’s not a surprise that criminals are committing fraud at astounding levels. While we have enjoyed the flexibilities this age of digital transformation has brought us, it’s essential to recognize the vulnerabilities that have been introduced, too.
It is important to remember that oftentimes, fraudsters operate in groups to execute scams and attacks. Rarely is it a singular data breach, hack, or scam responsible for your leaked information and financial losses – it is rather multiple hacks that held various pieces of your information that were used to build a profile on you on the dark web.
A few things Outseer urges people to do is to protect themselves from fraudsters by updating passwords regularly, using varying passwords between different sites, making sure to check financial statements to monitor for unknown purchases and fraudulent activity, as well as making sure to research payment methods you are unfamiliar with before signing up.
And finally, what’s next for Outseer?
With numerous types of emerging payment methods and technology trends shaping the world, including BNPL, Cryptocurrency, and more, Outseer is working to evaluate the security risks of each new method to stay ahead of fraudsters and stop scams before irreversible damage is done.
Outseer is addressing these new methods and rising fraud trends while maintaining and updating current products to reflect changes in the evolving fraud and cybersecurity landscape. We recently announced the development of our Buy Now Pay Later solution – a product under our new Outseer Emerging Payments solution that authenticates users’ identities at multiple points in the BNPL process to prevent fraud before it happens. We are excited to continue expanding our offerings to stop fraud in its tracks across all avenues.",,"breach, credit card, fraud, malware, phishing, scam",6,2022-05-21,"Fraudsters are looking to Capitalize on the Mounting International Tensions | Outseer.

During our May 3rd webinar, I discussed the intersection of cyberfraud and AI and unveiled what we do at Outseer to help protect businesses and consumers alike. As the realm of fraud continues to evolve, this is indeed a brave new world.
Outseer FraudAction is a solution to protect customers from phishing, scams, and bad actors that abuse your brand – and the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT promises explosive growth for attackers targeting your customers with phishing and scams. Fraud is endlessly innovative, and since broad access to advanced LLMs is a recent development, we have not yet seen the full impact of this leap in fraud. Recent events like the leak of Meta’s LLaMA LLM adds more complications to forecasting future developments in fraud. In this blog post, we will explore how new AI like ChatGPT might help attackers with phishing, scamming, and cybercrime, and steps organizations can take to protect themselves and their customers from AI-enabled cybercrime.
LLMs, like ChatGPT, are a type of AI that can generate human-like text. These models are trained on massive datasets of written language and can generate convincing, natural-sounding text that can be difficult to distinguish from human writing. LLMs can be trained to generate phishing emails, social engineering messages, and other types of cybercrime lures that are difficult to detect. Attackers can use LLMs to create sophisticated pretexts that are tailored to individual victims at scale, making targeted fraud attacks more accessible to scammers of all experience and skill levels.
Cybercriminal scams share many scaling bottlenecks with legitimate business development. Sending e-mails or placing advertisements can be easily scaled up to reach a large potential audience, but responding promptly to all responses still requires a human element that cannot easily keep pace. Automation leveraging LLMs enables a small criminal group — or even a single attacker — to produce real-time personalized responses to an unlimited number of marks replying to lures. This is of particular concern with Business E-mail Compromise (BEC) attacks and investment scams, where the fraudster may need to engage with the victim for days or weeks to build rapport before trying to ask for a payment.
Phishing attacks have been around for years, but with LLMs, they are becoming increasingly sophisticated. LLMs can generate convincing emails that appear to come from reputable sources, making it easier for attackers to trick victims into divulging sensitive information or clicking on links that lead to malware. LLMs can be used to create convincing stories and pretexts that attackers can use to trick victims into giving up account login details, passwords, credit card numbers, and other valuable data. Attackers can use AI to augment their attacks, making them more efficient and effective. For example, LLMs can generate thousands of unique phishing emails in a matter of seconds, increasing the likelihood of success for attackers and reducing the ability of anti-phishing solutions to filter out phishing e-mails.
Ultimately, the best course of action is to be aware of the threat and take preventive measures to protect your organization and your customers. Being aware of breached and leaked information about your organization is the first step — attackers with insight into your organization have better chances of success when phishing employees and customers alike. Less available information means less material for LLMs to use when crafting customized lures.
Leveraging solutions like FraudAction that can hunt for leaked information while proactively scanning for brand abusing scams and phishing pages online and on social media, provides the strongest chance of staying ahead of advanced AI-supported cybercrime targeting your customers and organization. While LLMs and AI might revolutionize phishing and scams — fraud still has detectable infrastructure like fake social media presence and phishing pages that give away the attacker’s intent and, more importantly, are vulnerable to disruption by solutions like Outseer FraudAction.
When FraudAction is used in concert with the full line of Outseer products, your organization becomes a problematic target for attackers — and attackers are looking for high success rates at scale. No solution will stop 100% of attacks, but simply being proactive building defense reduces the number of attackers willing to try to victimize your customers and organization.

How Banks and Nations Can Stop Scams: A Framework for Coordinated Defense | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/how-banks-and-nations-can-stop-scams,2025-10-01,"How Banks and Nations Can Stop Scams: A Framework for Coordinated Defense
Scams are now a national security threat. Learn 10 key strategies from Outseer’s new whitepaper on building a coordinated defense against fraud.
A Growing National Security Threat
Scams are no longer just a banking issue—they’re a growing national security threat. While banks have invested heavily in controls, fraudsters are evolving faster. Outseer's latest whitepaper, Consumer Scam Controls, which I co-authored with Ken Palla, outlines a coordinated framework to stop scams across the entire ecosystem.
The UK was the first country in the world to flag scams as a National Security Threat, which led to controls being deployed earlier. Other countries are now having the same realization, and forging forward with new perspectives on the problem.
What Does Great Look Like?
Due to the rapidly evolving nature of the attacks, it can be difficult to know what detection mechanisms best work together. These issues are fundamental to all fraud fighters, whether in a financial institution or elsewhere, and there is a need for a list of best practices to benchmark themselves against.
Ten Key Learnings
1. Controls are effective at different parts of the Scam
The whitepaper includes a Scam Attack Chain which looks at five different stages. We cover not just the transaction, but what happens before and after it.
2. Regulated or Legislative Controls
Government or regulator mandated controls give a level playing field. Customers are less likely to be disadvantaged dependent on their choice of bank.
3. Reimbursement
Reimbursement is not necessarily the answer, as Australia has shown a whole ecosystem approach means all parties involved improve. The UK has financial institutions reimburse putting the onus on banks and losses have not declined as much.
4. The Earlier the Better
To reduce the volume of attacks controls need to be effective earlier in the chain before the scam itself. Telcos, tech companies and social media need to improve as well as the banks.
5. English Speaking World Led Controls But Has Fallen Behind
UK and Australia originally took the lead in controls due to scam attacks. Asia is now rapidly catching up and exceeding them with innovative controls.
6. Intelligence is the Key
Data sharing is needed to improve controls learning from when scams get through. Learn what goes wrong and share actionable intelligence (see our Data Sharing whitepaper on this).
7. Some Areas Need to Do Better
The USA and Europe are lagging in controls compared to the leaders. Their citizens are disadvantaged and losing the most money.
8. One Size Does Not Fit All
Controls now need to consider customer demographics in a digital age. Elderly or vulnerable customers end up more at risk due to them not being experienced in the channel.
9. The AI Arms Race is Real
AI is being used by the attackers, with GenAI being widely deployed with deepfake images, voice and videos. Defenders need to make full use of AI in their controls to counter this industrialization.
10. Co-Ordination Gives Better Capability
National Anti-Scam centers will speed up country level responses by bringing together all parties. Global capability via industry associations (e.g., GSMA), global tech companies (e.g., Google) and scam specific organizations (e.g., GASA).
Failure to Respond Means Tragic Consequences
We’re building this list into a living resource for Fraud Leaders. There are emerging capabilities, especially in crypto, to recover the stolen monies that have not been documented yet.
Inaction at any point in the Attack Chain means the bad guys win, and people will continue to fall victims to the epidemic of attacks that currently shows no sign of slowing down. At Outseer we are building on our heritage with new novel capabilities being developed; we see the human side of fraud as the next challenge to focus on, with AI already changing the world as we know it faster than anyone expected.

How Mule Accounts Are Used to Launder Dirty Money | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/how-mule-accounts-are-used-to-launder-dirty-money,2024-02-15,"How Mule Accounts Are Used to Launder Dirty Money
A big part of threat intelligence and payment fraud is mule detection. Mules, or money mules if you will, are utilized by criminals to move illicit funds from account to account. Fraudsters recruit money mules to move illicit funds through their bank accounts, often in exchange for a small percentage of the funds, for the sole purpose of laundering dirty money before it is deposited into a legitimate account.
Mule accounts can be problematic in a variety of industries. However, they present the biggest issues in financial services. Without even knowing it, financial services organizations could be accepting payments and deposits consisting of laundered money that went through multiple mule accounts before arriving at its final destination.
How Accounts Are Established
A typical mule account is established through some sort of fraudulent recruitment. Criminals recruit unwitting participants through social media, online job sites, and the like. The promise of easy money is too much to resist among people who don’t do their due diligence before accepting what they believe are legitimate jobs. What they don’t realize is that the easy money jobs they are being recruited for are merely a front for laundering money. Students might be more susceptible to becoming money mules due to the increasing cost of living, and a need for additional income, as data from Barclays shows that their essential spending has gone up three times more than the average person.
According to Interpol, job scams are just one way to recruit money mules. There are others, including:
- Romance scams perpetrated through social media or online dating services
- Investment scams promising big returns on minimal investments
- Impersonation scams conducted via email or telephone
Regardless of how mules are recruited, they are hooked by some sort of incentive that causes them to overlook the suspicious nature of the opportunity at hand. Once hooked, a mule is entangled in a criminal enterprise.
How Money Is Laundered
With a mule account established, illicit funds are deposited. They are then cashed out shortly thereafter. The process can be repeated multiple times when money is especially dirty. The ultimate goal is to deposit and withdraw the funds as many times as necessary to make the money nearly impossible to trace.
The mule’s role in all of this is to facilitate the transactions. The mule accepts funds to be deposited into their account. The money is then forwarded through some untraceable means, like cryptocurrency or a money transfer service.
Detection & Exploitation
Why criminals use mule accounts should be obvious. The two primary reasons are avoiding detection and exploiting victims. Avoiding detection is at the top of the list. However, it is worth noting that laundering and the practice of utilizing money mules are not new. Money laundering was happening long before the internet and digital technologies.
Technology only makes it easier because funds can now be transferred electronically and instantly. They can be converted into cryptocurrency, laundered through multiple accounts, and then converted back to fiat.
As far as exploitation is concerned, criminals open mule accounts and use them to launder money fully aware that the people and organizations whose names are on those accounts could ultimately take the fall if the authorities catch on. Letting their victims take the fall is part of the strategy behind moving money through mules.
A Constant Battle
Money mules and mule accounts have been an ongoing problem for decades. Financial institutions are engaged in a constant and never-ending battle against criminals looking to launder their dirty money. Combining efforts with our solutions and services to stop them rest in detecting mule activities and patterns, mule accounts and addresses intelligence, and several other strategies.
Funds obtained through illicit activities are targeted by financial institutions, government authorities, and security experts alike. The only way to stop threat actors from taking advantage of mule accounts is to proactively flag, monitor, and investigate known mule accounts and addresses and educate account holders of the consequences of being caught while enhancing systems and controls for customer onboarding.
As long as criminals can get away with it, they will continue using money mules and incentivise account holders to become mules. We will continue applying threat intelligence and other strategies to detect mule accounts and shut them down.",,"fraud, money laundering, payment fraud, scam",4,2024-02-15,"How Mule Accounts Are Used to Launder Dirty Money | Outseer.

Insights from Outseer’s Global Fraud & Scams Trends Report | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/insights-from-outseers-global-fraud-scams-trends-report,2024-06-24,"Insights from Outseer’s Global Fraud & Scams Trends Report
As cyber fraud evolves, our strategies must advance as well. Outseer’s annual 2024 Global Fraud & Scams Trends Report provides crucial insights for financial institutions.
Based on data from Outseer’s FraudAction 24/7 Anti-Fraud Command Center (AFCC), this report summarizes key cyber threats from the past year. With 20 years of data gathered from hundreds of clients worldwide, we have gained unique insights into the continuously evolving fraud trends.
Outseer’s analysis of global fraud trends across various attack vectors in 2023 reveals the year-over-year changes in the overall volume of attacks. Below you can find a summary the changes and key trends:
Key Trends
Trend 1: Banking Trojans and Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)
While the volume of fraud observed grew 108%, malware attacks overall grew a staggering 4,000% or 40X growth in volume, partially due to the increase of malware in mobile channels. This surge was driven by the increase in Malware as a Service, where non-technical fraudsters access malicious software for a fee. Notable malware families include Hydra, Cerberus, and Octo, all contributing to increased Command-and-Control (C2) infrastructure.
While phishing saw a moderate attack increase, brand abuse and rogue mobile app attacks saw a decrease in volume. However, Trojan horse attacks saw sizable increases in the volume of attacks. The rise of Android Banking Trojans surged by 120% in the first half of 2023 alone. This resulted in their share of total attacks increasing from 5% to 11% year-over-year.
Hook Leak
The leak of the Hook Android banking Trojan’s APK and Panel source code in 2023 led to significant growth in HookBot Command and Control Centers (C&Cs), with over 200 new C&Cs detected late in the year. Hook leak contributed to the 20% surge in malware attacks.
Post in fraud forum Translated from Russian by DukeEugene advertising Hook
A Rise in Digital Banking Fuels Attacks Through Mobile
Mobile app usage continues to increase, and now comprises 85% in total traffic. Outseer has seen that the increase in this channel was accompanied by a parallel trend in increased mobile fraud, with 62% of detected fraud originating from mobile apps. This underscores the urgent need for implementing tailored and robust security measures to effectively address the escalating threat landscape within the mobile domain.
Trend 2: Instant Payment Scams
Outseer has seen a significant uptick in unauthorized push payments, mule accounts, and account takeovers in markets where faster payment adoption is high. Surveyed financial institutions saw a spike in fraud attacks using real-time rail: 57% reported mule activity was up, 71% reported consumer ATO had increased, and 62% reported APP fraud had increased.
Faster payments have seen global adoption, leading to increased authorized push payments (APP), mule accounts, and account takeovers. The UK reported £485 million ($618 million) in APP scam losses in 2023, with projections of $4.6 billion by 2026. The US saw over $10 billion in fraud losses, a 14% increase from 2022.
With the introduction of FEDNOW in the US and the increasing adoption of instant payment systems across the globe, combined with the success fraudsters are seeing in these types of scams, more opportunities for scams are expected.
Stopping these scams is difficult because the victims authorize the transactions, often without the realization they are a scam target until after the payment clears.
Identifying Mule Accounts Is a Key Step in Stopping Fraudsters
- Leverage a risk-based approach and take advantage of machine learning that profiles the sender and recipient to more accurately detect mule activities
- Update policies to track beneficiary transaction velocity and unusual amounts
- Utilize a data network such as the Outseer Global Data Network to help share mule accounts intelligence with other organizations
- Tap into the timely insights of web intelligence services such as Outseer Fraud Action Services to identify confirmed mule accounts in addition to compromised email addresses that can be tied to accounts
Rising Liability Shifts
With the rapid increase in faster payment fraud, some governments are enacting or are considering legislation to ensure more support for victims, with the discussion centering around liability shift.
The UK & EU Are on the Forefront of Regulation
The UK and EU have been at the forefront of change with the introduction of the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) and the upcoming Payment Services Directive 3 (PSD3). In late 2024, the specifics of PSD3 and the implementation of the PSR liability shift will be revealed. As these regulatory changes unfold, financial institutions should stay informed and prepare for potential adjustments in compliance requirements based on the finalized PSD3 framework.
The most important part of the liability changes is that financial institutions and payment service providers must reimburse all in-scope customers that are victims of APP scams, within certain limits. The sending and receiving financial institutions and payment service providers will share the cost of reimbursements to victims 50-50.
Strategic objectives of the PSR reimbursement:
- Decrease the instances of APP fraud
- Improve protection of payment system users
- Incentivize payment service providers to focus on resources to prevent scams
- Increase confidence in the Faster Payment Scheme (FPS)
- Create agile rules to enable the operator to manage evolving fraud threats
While not mandated to adopt any regulation, those outside of the UK and EU could benefit from the learnings.
Trend 3: AI-Powered Scams
AI Fueling Scam Growth
AI has dominated the headlines over the past year and fraudsters have already begun to exploit this technology, with several major scams reported globally. With new AI tools and technology at their disposal, fraudsters are creating varied phishing emails that defeat existing scam and spam email filters. In addition to improving tried-and-true techniques, fraudsters are using AI more often on deepfakes, voice cloning, verification fraud, and authorized push payment (APP) fraud.
While Outseer didn’t see direct fraud losses from generative AI in 2023, we predict that the scams and corresponding losses will continue to grow. Given the goal of generative AI scams is to trick people into believing what fraudsters put out there, Outseer does believe that generative AI contributed to the increased effectiveness of phishing tactics that fueled an even larger increase in Trojan attacks and malware attacks.
Generative AI is enhancing phishing tactics, making scams more convincing. Tools like OpenAI’s Sora can produce hyper-realistic videos, raising concerns about deepfakes and misinformation. The ethical implications and risks of such powerful software are under scrutiny as new Generative AI capabilities are released.
Screenshot from “Beyond Our Reality” (Sora & Donald Allen Stevenson III)
Despite the ways generative AI is being manipulated, predictive AI has also played a pivotal role in detecting cyber threats such as brand abuse, phishing, Trojans, and rogue mobile apps. The strength of AI and machine learning in combating these threats lies in their ability to continuously learn, adapt, and detect evolving patterns of malicious behavior across various digital landscapes. These technologies enable proactive and adaptive security measures, ultimately contributing to a more robust defense against cyber threats.
How Can Financial Institutions & Payment Service Providers Mitigate APP Fraud?
Financial institutions and payment service providers that enhance internal controls can shield themselves from liability-shift losses. Implementing controls can mitigate risk while protecting customers from fraudsters who seek to circumvent an FI’s internal controls by using money mules and executing APP frauds.
Strategic Recommendations
In implementing a robust defense against scams, a multi-layered approach is essential.

Insights from Outseer’s Global Fraud & Scams Trends Report
As cyber fraud evolves, our strategies must advance as well. Outseer’s annual 2024 Global Fraud & Scams Trends Report provides crucial insights for financial institutions.
Based on data from Outseer’s FraudAction 24/7 Anti-Fraud Command Center (AFCC), this report summarizes key cyber threats from the past year. With 20 years of data gathered from hundreds of clients worldwide, we have gained unique insights into the continuously evolving fraud trends.
Outseer’s analysis of global fraud trends across various attack vectors in 2023 reveals the year-over-year changes in the overall volume of attacks. Below you can find a summary the changes and key trends:
Key Trends
Trend 1: Banking Trojans and Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)
While the volume of fraud observed grew 108%, malware attacks overall grew a staggering 4,000% or 40X growth in volume, partially due to the increase of malware in mobile channels. This surge was driven by the increase in Malware as a Service, where non-technical fraudsters access malicious software for a fee. Notable malware families include Hydra, Cerberus, and Octo, all contributing to increased Command-and-Control (C2) infrastructure.
While phishing saw a moderate attack increase, brand abuse and rogue mobile app attacks saw a decrease in volume. However, Trojan horse attacks saw sizable increases in the volume of attacks. The rise of Android Banking Trojans surged by 120% in the first half of 2023 alone. This resulted in their share of total attacks increasing from 5% to 11% year-over-year.
Hook Leak
The leak of the Hook Android banking Trojan’s APK and Panel source code in 2023 led to significant growth in HookBot Command and Control Centers (C&Cs), with over 200 new C&Cs detected late in the year. Hook leak contributed to the 20% surge in malware attacks.

A Rise in Digital Banking Fuels Attacks Through Mobile
Mobile app usage continues to increase, and now comprises 85% in total traffic. Outseer has seen that the increase in this channel was accompanied by a parallel trend in increased mobile fraud, with 62% of detected fraud originating from mobile apps. This underscores the urgent need for implementing tailored and robust security measures to effectively address the escalating threat landscape within the mobile domain.
Trend 2: Instant Payment Scams
Outseer has seen a significant uptick in unauthorized push payments, mule accounts, and account takeovers in markets where faster payment adoption is high. Surveyed financial institutions saw a spike in fraud attacks using real-time rail: 57% reported mule activity was up, 71% reported consumer ATO had increased, and 62% reported APP fraud had increased.
Faster payments have seen global adoption, leading to increased authorized push payments (APP), mule accounts, and account takeovers. The UK reported £485 million ($618 million) in APP scam losses in 2023, with projections of $4.6 billion by 2026. The US saw over $10 billion in fraud losses, a 14% increase from 2022.
With the introduction of FEDNOW in the US and the increasing adoption of instant payment systems across the globe, combined with the success fraudsters are seeing in these types of scams, more opportunities for scams are expected.
Stopping these scams is difficult because the victims authorize the transactions, often without the realization they are a scam target until after the payment clears.
Identifying Mule Accounts Is a Key Step in Stopping Fraudsters
- Leverage a risk-based approach and take advantage of machine learning that profiles the sender and recipient to more accurately detect mule activities
- Update policies to track beneficiary transaction velocity and unusual amounts
- Utilize a data network such as the Outseer Global Data Network to help share mule accounts intelligence with other organizations
- Tap into the timely insights of web intelligence services such as Outseer Fraud Action Services to identify confirmed mule accounts in addition to compromised email addresses that can be tied to accounts
Rising Liability Shifts
With the rapid increase in faster payment fraud, some governments are enacting or are considering legislation to ensure more support for victims, with the discussion centering around liability shift.
The UK & EU Are on the Forefront of Regulation
The UK and EU have been at the forefront of change with the introduction of the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) and the upcoming Payment Services Directive 3 (PSD3). In late 2024, the specifics of PSD3 and the implementation of the PSR liability shift will be revealed. As these regulatory changes unfold, financial institutions should stay informed and prepare for potential adjustments in compliance requirements based on the finalized PSD3 framework.
The most important part of the liability changes is that financial institutions and payment service providers must reimburse all in-scope customers that are victims of APP scams, within certain limits. The sending and receiving financial institutions and payment service providers will share the cost of reimbursements to victims 50-50.
Strategic objectives of the PSR reimbursement:
- Decrease the instances of APP fraud
- Improve protection of payment system users
- Incentivize payment service providers to focus on resources to prevent scams
- Increase confidence in the Faster Payment Scheme (FPS)
- Create agile rules to enable the operator to manage evolving fraud threats
While not mandated to adopt any regulation, those outside of the UK and EU could benefit from the learnings.
Trend 3: AI-Powered Scams
AI Fueling Scam Growth
AI has dominated the headlines over the past year and fraudsters have already begun to exploit this technology, with several major scams reported globally. With new AI tools and technology at their disposal, fraudsters are creating varied phishing emails that defeat existing scam and spam email filters. In addition to improving tried-and-true techniques, fraudsters are using AI more often on deepfakes, voice cloning, verification fraud, and authorized push payment (APP) fraud.
While Outseer didn’t see direct fraud losses from generative AI in 2023, we predict that the scams and corresponding losses will continue to grow. Given the goal of generative AI scams is to trick people into believing what fraudsters put out there, Outseer does believe that generative AI contributed to the increased effectiveness of phishing tactics that fueled an even larger increase in Trojan attacks and malware attacks.
Generative AI is enhancing phishing tactics, making scams more convincing. Tools like OpenAI’s Sora can produce hyper-realistic videos, raising concerns about deepfakes and misinformation. The ethical implications and risks of such powerful software are under scrutiny as new Generative AI capabilities are released.

Despite the ways generative AI is being manipulated, predictive AI has also played a pivotal role in detecting cyber threats such as brand abuse, phishing, Trojans, and rogue mobile apps. The strength of AI and machine learning in combating these threats lies in their ability to continuously learn, adapt, and detect evolving patterns of malicious behavior across various digital landscapes. These technologies enable proactive and adaptive security measures, ultimately contributing to a more robust defense against cyber threats.
How Can Financial Institutions & Payment Service Providers Mitigate APP Fraud?
Financial institutions and payment service providers that enhance internal controls can shield themselves from liability-shift losses. Implementing controls can mitigate risk while protecting customers from fraudsters who seek to circumvent an FI’s internal controls by using money mules and executing APP frauds.
Strategic Recommendations
In implementing a robust defense against scams, a multi-layered approach is essential. First, limiting fraudsters’ access to customer credentials and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is paramount. And while many organizations may overlook actively tracking scams, it’s crucial to track and tag scam attacks for analysis. By tracking scams, businesses can analyze data and refine their mitigation strategies accordingly.

How Machine Learning + Data Science Can Detect & Prevent Payment Fraud | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/machine-learning-data-science-can-prevent-payment-fraud,2021-09-27,"How Machine Learning + Data Science Can Detect & Prevent Payment Fraud
Curious about how machine learning helps anti-fraud systems recognize various behaviors and user attributes? This article explains that, in addition to how data science can prevent payment fraud.
The only thing digital transformation has changed over the past 18 months is … everything. How we live, how we shop, who we trust—it’s all being reshaped by market forces and digital innovation. But as the pace of change and consumer demands accelerate, organizations need to be prepared for the potential risks and profound challenges that come with them.
By now, it seems most people in the payments space have come to understand that advances in machine learning and data science are the answer. But most still have questions about why it’s so important, how it works, and which approaches are best for protecting against fraud?
With that in mind, I figured I’d share some of the kinds of questions put to me recently, in hopes my answers can provide some helpful insight.
What sectors are most at risk of fraud; is it only payments, or are there other forms of fraud to look out for?
Cybercriminals are opportunists, and they always follow the money. With consumer adoption of digital channels leading to $1 trillion growth in ecommerce and digital banking, fraudsters are particularly focused on exploiting applications that are newer to the market.
Think digital wallets, Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, as well as applications that have been around for a while—like card-not-present (CNP) and bank transfer fraud. Consumers love the speed, ease, and convenience these services offer. Which means organizations must find ways to deliver the fast, frictionless transaction experience consumers demand without sacrificing security.
These trends are most pronounced in ecommerce, obviously, where CNP transactions are essential. Increasingly, however, embedded finance is coming to the fore. According to Adobe, the number of people choosing BNPL for online purchases rose 215% from early 2020 to early 2021. Because these payment methods are still very much in their infancy, issuers and brands alike are navigating the associated fraud risk.
Brand abuse is also on the rise. In these attacks, fraudsters impersonate trusted brands and banks in bogus social media pages, phishing emails, and malicious mobile banking apps aimed at stealing credentials or achieving account takeover. As documented in our latest fraud trends report, brand abuse now factors into the majority of all fraud attacks—growing 68% in just 90 days.
How is machine learning used to detect and stop fraud?
When you’re talking about the scale and sophistication of attacks financial services organizations are seeing, machine learning and big data analytics are required to identify fraudulent transactions.
Traditional fraud detection systems are rules-based, which means they’re always fighting yesterday’s battle based on established and recognizable threats. Machine learning can dive far deeper, working to understand the complex interactions that occur prior to an attack. Assessing the context for a transaction and the relationships associated with it are absolutely key.
While the information in question depends on the suspicious behavior itself, machine learning is able to examine numerous variables—such as the type of payment being made, the origin of the payment, whether the payment is consistent with previous transactions from that particular user—along with hundreds more, in real time. Machine learning helps anti-fraud systems learn and remember various behaviors and user attributes so that they can be prepared for the eventuality of a fraudulent transaction in the future.
Is this purely a cost center, or does it provide enough value-add to attract and retain customers?
As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, we must too. To address fraud risk in a way that’s not just acceptable but is actually delightful to end users, you have to invest in tools and solutions that are powered by modern machine learning and a very high level of data science expertise.
Here’s why. Machine learning algorithms and the risk scores they generate are only as good as the experts who train them, and the quality and scale of the underlying dataset that informs them. When your anti-fraud systems are able to effortlessly prevent 95% of all fraud loss and reserve step-up challenges for only those scant 5% of transactions that may require additional scrutiny, customers enjoy a fast, friendly transaction experience. The absence of that is noticeable and unforgivable to fickle consumers, who’ve been shown to bail on a transaction after even just a few seconds of friction.
As a result, look for card issuers, banks, and other payments providers to prioritize solutions that combine machine learning and data science with the kind of global, cross-industry intelligence needed to recognize threats before a transaction even begins. And that means card issuers experience more “top-of-wallet” loyalty when consumers make purchases, leading to more revenue for banks and card networks. And higher approval rates means more legitimate transactions get completed successfully, leading to higher revenues for merchants and more interchange fees for issuers.
Add it all up, and you’re talking about a huge value-add that can only be achieved with machine learning and data science.

MITM: How To Deal With Man-in-the-Middle Cyberattacks | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/man-in-the-middle-cyberattacks,2022-07-14,"MITM: How To Deal With Man-in-the-Middle Cyberattacks
MITM attacks or Man-in-the-Middle attacks are cybercrimes in which perpetrators intercept and exploit communications or data transmissions between two parties. Read on to learn how to protect your organization from this fraudulent action.
MITM attacks or Man-in-the-Middle attacks are cybercrimes in which perpetrators intercept and exploit communications or data transmissions between two parties. Other common abbreviations for this type of attack include MitM, MiM, and MIM. Let’s take a closer look at MITM attacks and possible prevention tactics.
What Are MITM Attacks?
In MITM attacks, cybercriminals secretly intercept data transactions or communications between two parties in order to gain access to sensitive information, sabotage communications, or corrupt data for financial gain.
Sometimes this involves the perpetrator impersonating one of the parties in order to trick the other into revealing confidential information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, bank account details, and more. This can include cybercriminals who spoof or infiltrate email accounts at financial institutions in order to send fraudulent email messages that dupe customers into making transfers to outside bank accounts controlled by the perpetrators.
Attacks designed to infect browsers with malicious code are often referred to as a Man-In-The-Browser attack. The objective here is to access data sent and received through the user’s web browser during transactions.
This data includes logins and other information within e-commerce and banking sites. It can even include redirecting transactions by changing the destination account or amount being sent.
Because these attacks are carried out in real time, they often go undetected until it’s too late.
Two Key Phases of MITM Attacks
There are two phases to successful MITM attacks: interception and decryption.
Interception Phase: Finding a Place in the Middle
In the interception phase, cybercriminals find a way to intercept traffic between the two victims. Some of the most common methods of this include the following:
IP Spoofing
In this method, attackers alter the source IP address in the outgoing packet header of a website, email server, or other device. The target user’s computer sees the package as coming from a legitimate source and accepts it. This tricks the user into believing they are interacting with a trusted source, when in fact the sensitive information they share during the transaction is routed straight to the cybercriminals.
DNS Spoofing
In DNS spoofing attacks, the attacker modifies the DNS (Domain Name Server) records of a legitimate website, redirecting traffic to a malicious imposter site. When victims attempt to visit what’s presented as a secure and trusted website, they are instead redirected to the attacker’s fake site. This is where the victim’s sensitive information is collected for the attacker.
Wi-Fi Eavesdropping
During this form of attack, cyber-thieves steal personal or corporate web, email, and messaging data through unsecured wi-fi networks. They could set up public hotspots with names that closely resemble those of nearby businesses or networks, tricking users into connecting to these “evil twins”, putting their data at risk.
ARP Spoofing
One common form of ARP spoofing occurs when the attacker sends fake ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to associate their MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate user’s device on a local area network. This allows the attacker to gain access to any data sent from the victim’s IP address, where they can view or modify information before sending the traffic to its intended destination.
Decryption Phase: Reading The Encrypted Traffic
In the decryption phase, attackers must decrypt all the traffic they have intercepted in order to read the exchanged data. Using a proxy server sitting between the two parties, the attacker can employ several techniques to accomplish this—including SSL stripping, SSL hijacking, and HTTPS spoofing.
SSL Stripping
In SSL stripping, an attacker interrupts the security of a connection between a user and websites they visit. This is accomplished by “stripping” secure HTTPS connections of their Secure Socket Layer (SSL), downgrading the user’s connection to an unsecured HTTP version of the same site. This gives the attacker access to the secure site along with the user’s activity and any sensitive information in its unencrypted form. If the user transacts on any retail or banking sites the transaction and all data is directed to the attackers in plain text format. The website will fulfills the transaction because it has a secure connection with a computer—the attacker’s, which is acting as a proxy.
HTTPS Spoofing
HTTPS spoofing attacks are similar to SSL hijacking attacks, but in this case, the attacker uses a fake SSL certificate instead of a valid one. This certificate is used to fool victims into thinking they are connecting to a legitimate HTTPS website when they are actually connecting to the attacker’s malicious version of the website instead. The victim then inputs sensitive information, falsely assuming that the SSL certificate guarantees a secure connection.
Session Hijacking
These attacks involve the unauthorized use of session ID information to take over a browser session initiated by the user. Through their own web browser, the attackers are able to trick a legitimate website into thinking the attacker’s connection is the same as the user’s original session. This leaves the attacker free to drain bank accounts or make fraudulent purchases as if they were the legitimate user.
Who Is Vulnerable To MITM Attacks?
MITM attacks can be carried out against any individual or organization. MITM attacks are often hard to detect because attackers can hide their phishing activities in the vast amount of Internet traffic. Victims may not know they’re being attacked until it’s too late. That’s why prevention is far more important than detection if you want to be protected from MITM attacks. And spoiler alert: You do.
When an MITM attack leads to a breach of customers’ private data, companies pay $4.23 million on average, and depending on the industry, attendant regulatory fines can run as high as $487K or more.
When an MITM causes reputational damage through breaches or direct customer financial losses, other customers and prospects can grow wary of doing business with your organization. Lost customer trust and even just heightened customer suspicion can impact a company’s revenue.
Prevention Over Detection: Personal Security Measures
- When it comes to MITM attacks, putting safety first and thinking twice before sharing sensitive data on the Internet are the best tactics. A few tips can help you with that.
- Use antivirus software to protect against security threats.
- Install HTTPS Everywhere, a browser extension that enforces HTTPS in all connections and prevents cybercriminals from downgrading your connection from HTTPS to HTTP.
- Avoid Wi-Fi networks that aren’t password-protected —especially for sensitive transactions that require personal information.
- Turn on VPN (Virtual Private Network) when using a public internet connection. VPNs keep your private data encrypted, meaning attackers can’t read or use it.
- Don’t stay logged into financial websites, such as an online banking or a PayPal account.
- Don’t use the same password for all your accounts, and change your passwords on a regular basis.
- Use a password manager to ensure your set passwords are as strong as possible.
How to Protect Organizations from MITM Attacks
Organizations have a greater responsibility for installing proper defenses against MITM attacks, given the data security risks they pose to customers, employees, partners, and more. With that in mind, organizations are advised to do the following.
Invest in a Proactive Cybersecurity Team
Having an internal team of cybersecurity experts is an important step for protecting your company from MITM attacks and countless other cyber threats. These experts must continuously monitor your network for suspicious activity, identify vulnerabilities, and deploy countermeasures to prevent or neutralize attacks. They should also have a rapid response plan in the event of successful attacks.
By being proactive, you can help mitigate the damage caused by an MITM attack and protect your company’s data and its customers. But word to the wise: While deep packet inspection (DPI) and other forms of forensic analysis can help identify anomalous traffic that could signal a MITM attack, they’re inherently after-the-fact. Basic Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) and patch management only go so far. A go-it-alone approach is not advised. Outside expertise, tools, and data can make all the difference between success and failure in your security stack.
Deploy Digital Risk Protection
Besides employing strong firewalls, endpoint security, or properly configured servers and systems, your layered approach to digital risk management must entail assessing, monitoring, and neutralizing threats that can wreak operational, financial, and reputational carnage—including MITM attacks—before they cause harm.
This includes defenses against schemes that exploit your corporate identity, network, or accounts in the intercept phase of MITM attacks. It also requires protections against attempts to weaponize compromised connections between users and your website or other digital properties.
Outseer’s own digital risk solutions, for instance, include comprehensive, 24/7 threat management services that keep your employees and customers safe from phishing and malware used in the intercept phase of MITM attacks. They also include risk-based payment authentication and account monitoring tools that detect 95% of fraud stemming from the attempted exploitation of intercepted data and communications, with intervention rates as low as 5%. That’s the best performance in the industry.
Train Employees on Best Practices Against MITM Attacks
If your employees are unaware of the threat of MITM attacks, they may be more likely to interact with platforms or websites that could put your company at risk. Educate your staff, especially remote workers, on implementing a VPN before going online, using HTTPS Everywhere, avoiding public Wi-Fi networks at all costs, and other basic forms of cyber-hygiene that help thwart MITM and other attacks. Host frequent team discussions and training sessions on cybersecurity, so everyone is up to date on the latest threats and how to stop them.
Ditching the ‘Middle’ Man, Not Your Digital Operations
MITM attacks can be challenging to detect and prevent, but there are a few things you can do to reduce the risk. Investing in proper defenses and increasing employee awareness are the best ways to protect your company.
If you think your company has been the victim of a MITM attack, it’s essential to act quickly. Notify your security team and investigate the incident thoroughly. Restoring data from backups, changing passwords, and network monitoring can help mitigate the damage caused by an attack.
But remember: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of detection.

MITM: How To Deal With Man-in-the-Middle Cyberattacks
MITM attacks or Man-in-the-Middle attacks are cybercrimes in which perpetrators intercept and exploit communications or data transmissions between two parties. Read on to learn how to protect your organization from this fraudulent action.
MITM attacks or Man-in-the-Middle attacks are cybercrimes in which perpetrators intercept and exploit communications or data transmissions between two parties. Other common abbreviations for this type of attack include MitM, MiM, and MIM. Let’s take a closer look at MITM attacks and possible prevention tactics.
What Are MITM Attacks?
In MITM attacks, cybercriminals secretly intercept data transactions or communications between two parties in order to gain access to sensitive information, sabotage communications, or corrupt data for financial gain.
Sometimes this involves the perpetrator impersonating one of the parties in order to trick the other into revealing confidential information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, bank account details, and more. This can include cybercriminals who spoof or infiltrate email accounts at financial institutions in order to send fraudulent email messages that dupe customers into making transfers to outside bank accounts controlled by the perpetrators.
Attacks designed to infect browsers with malicious code are often referred to as a Man-In-The-Browser attack. The objective here is to access data sent and received through the user’s web browser during transactions.
This data includes logins and other information within e-commerce and banking sites. It can even include redirecting transactions by changing the destination account or amount being sent.
Because these attacks are carried out in real time, they often go undetected until it’s too late.
Two Key Phases of MITM Attacks
There are two phases to successful MITM attacks: interception and decryption.
Interception Phase: Finding a Place in the Middle
In the interception phase, cybercriminals find a way to intercept traffic between the two victims. Some of the most common methods of this include the following:
IP Spoofing
In this method, attackers alter the source IP address in the outgoing packet header of a website, email server, or other device. The target user’s computer sees the package as coming from a legitimate source and accepts it. This tricks the user into believing they are interacting with a trusted source, when in fact the sensitive information they share during the transaction is routed straight to the cybercriminals.
DNS Spoofing
In DNS spoofing attacks, the attacker modifies the DNS (Domain Name Server) records of a legitimate website, redirecting traffic to a malicious imposter site. When victims attempt to visit what’s presented as a secure and trusted website, they are instead redirected to the attacker’s fake site. This is where the victim’s sensitive information is collected for the attacker.
Wi-Fi Eavesdropping
During this form of attack, cyber-thieves steal personal or corporate web, email, and messaging data through unsecured wi-fi networks. They could set up public hotspots with names that closely resemble those of nearby businesses or networks, tricking users into connecting to these “evil twins”, putting their data at risk.
ARP Spoofing
One common form of ARP spoofing occurs when the attacker sends fake ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to associate their MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate user’s device on a local area network. This allows the attacker to gain access to any data sent from the victim’s IP address, where they can view or modify information before sending the traffic to its intended destination.
Decryption Phase: Reading The Encrypted Traffic
In the decryption phase, attackers must decrypt all the traffic they have intercepted in order to read the exchanged data. Using a proxy server sitting between the two parties, the attacker can employ several techniques to accomplish this—including SSL stripping, SSL hijacking, and HTTPS spoofing.
SSL Stripping
In SSL stripping, an attacker interrupts the security of a connection between a user and websites they visit. This is accomplished by “stripping” secure HTTPS connections of their Secure Socket Layer (SSL), downgrading the user’s connection to an unsecured HTTP version of the same site. This gives the attacker access to the secure site along with the user’s activity and any sensitive information in its unencrypted form. If the user transacts on any retail or banking sites the transaction and all data is directed to the attackers in plain text format. The website will fulfills the transaction because it has a secure connection with a computer—the attacker’s, which is acting as a proxy.
HTTPS Spoofing
HTTPS spoofing attacks are similar to SSL hijacking attacks, but in this case, the attacker uses a fake SSL certificate instead of a valid one. This certificate is used to fool victims into thinking they are connecting to a legitimate HTTPS website when they are actually connecting to the attacker’s malicious version of the website instead. The victim then inputs sensitive information, falsely assuming that the SSL certificate guarantees a secure connection.
Session Hijacking
These attacks involve the unauthorized use of session ID information to take over a browser session initiated by the user. Through their own web browser, the attackers are able to trick a legitimate website into thinking the attacker’s connection is the same as the user’s original session. This leaves the attacker free to drain bank accounts or make fraudulent purchases as if they were the legitimate user.
Who Is Vulnerable To MITM Attacks?
MITM attacks can be carried out against any individual or organization. MITM attacks are often hard to detect because attackers can hide their phishing activities in the vast amount of Internet traffic. Victims may not know they’re being attacked until it’s too late.

Worried about mobile phishing attacks impersonating your brand and targeting employees or customers? We explain mobile phishing methods and how to prevent them.
What Is Mobile Phishing?
Mobile phishing is a type of attack in which cybercriminals use sophisticated social engineering techniques to trick mobile users into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials or credit card numbers. These techniques often include the following:
- URL padding
- Smishing/SMS spoofing
- Tiny URLs
- Malicious apps/Screen overlays
Advancements in mobile technology have made working, shopping, and entertaining ourselves via smartphone easy and convenient. Unfortunately, scammers got the memo.
Today, fraudsters exploit both human trust and the design of mobile devices to carry out mobile phishing attacks by impersonating trusted individuals, companies, and brands. While most people are cautious of emails, many instinctively click messages on their phones. And the small screens of mobile devices can make it difficult to make out sender email addresses, phone numbers associated with text messages, website URLs, and more. Between that and the state of remote working during the pandemic, it’s not surprising that mobile phishing attacks increased 364% in 2020, according to Verizon’s 2021 Mobile Security Index.
Indeed, as Proofpoint reports, 84% of organizations were hit by mobile phishing attacks in 2020, with a vast majority of messages impersonating financial institutions. Mobile phishing can have devastating consequences resulting in data breaches, stolen credentials, and fraudulent money transfers costing an average of $14.8 million each year for US companies. And consumers? They lost $43 billion last year to brand impersonation in all its forms, including mobile phishing.
While the average loss is $1,100, some can lose much more. When your customers or others are phished into revealing credit card details, online banking credentials, or personal information like date of birth, address, or social security numbers, that data can be used in new attacks for years to come. And despite your company’s innocence, consumer trust may be irrevocably lost—while your brand is unfairly tarnished in social media tirades, negative news reports, and more.
Let’s explore some common mobile phishing techniques, and outline exactly what you can do to prevent them.
Mobile Phishing Techniques
URL Padding
Most attacks point intended victims to phishing sites designed to look exactly like the login page of the legitimate business being impersonated. URL padding exploits the smaller size of mobile screens to hide malicious URLs in the address bar.
Threat actors place real trusted domains at the front of the address bar followed by hyphens to hide the true destination. Below is an example of a URL padding attack with the true destination highlighted in bold.
hxxp://login.chase.com——-account-login-confirm-identity.info432a[dot]com/
hxxp://microsoft.com——————–secureaccount-confirm.mlcros0ft1[dot]com/
While these look suspicious on their own, they become a lot more convincing when loaded into a mobile browser. As seen below, the shorter address bar at the top hides the true destination at the end of the hyphens.
Attackers pair URL padding with a cloned version of a brand’s website to steal login details and trick victims into sending money to the wrong place. According to Google, there were 46,000 new phishing websites launched every week in 2020. This year, it’s likely to get worse.
What you can do: Train staff to recognize these types of attacks and ensure you’re using a modern browser that can alert you to this deceptive behavior. Browsers like Google Chrome will alert users to these attacks with a bright red screen and prevent the page from loading.
Businesses can protect company-owned devices by blocking malicious domains through Mobile Device Management (MDM) software.
They can also employ services such as Outseer FraudAction, our cyberattack monitoring and takedown service, which proactively hunts down and works to remove phishing sites and phony social media pages before they can cause serious damage to their customers, suppliers, or other consumers and businesses.
Smishing/SMS spoofing
Smishing, or SMS spoofing, exploits text messaging to trick users into clicking malicious links. Smishing attacks targeting a company’s employees are often an overlooked part of cybersecurity and can be challenging to detect.
Smishing campaigns can even impersonate C-level staff within an organization to trick other employees into sending sensitive information, installing malware, or making a fraudulent wire transfer. Smishing messages often send the victim to a fake login page to steal their data or silently install spyware onto the phone.
Below is an example of a smishing attack attempting to impersonate a mobile operator:
What you can do: Educate staff on the dangers of smishing and create procedures for conducting wire transfers and sending sensitive information. Be wary of typos and misspellings (see example above). Enable two-factor authentication on employee accounts to prevent attackers from logging in with any stolen credentials.
For enterprises, consider leveraging artificial intelligence to monitor your employees’ web traffic. AI applies machine-learning analysis to proactively monitor and block phishing sites accessed by employees via both mobile or desktop.
But what about your customers and others who may fall victim? Here again, our solution can help. The experts in our Anti-Fraud Command Center use AI and other tools to continuously monitor the threat landscape to shut down sites that impersonate your brand—regardless of whether the phishing messages sent to recipients were an email or a text message.
Tiny URLs
TinyURL is one of many shortening tools that helps users send shorter mobile-friendly links. While the service is legitimate, it’s also used by scammers to hide malicious links. The tool works by taking a long URL and replacing it with a shorter one. When the user clicks the short URL, it redirects to the original.
For instance, this URL—
hxxps://fakewebsite.ru/spyware/a212/x/installer.exe
would look like this—
hxxps://tinyurl.com/2021Q1Report
The challenge here is that URL-shortening tools serve a real purpose, but they are misused by cybercriminals. Fraudsters can customize shortened URLs to contain a brand name or make links seem like they are part of an attachment.
While a majority of URL shorteners attempt to monitor and stop abuse, many phishing attacks slip through the cracks. Fraudsters use chains of multiple URL redirects to evade detection from firewalls and link-shortening platforms. Users who recognize popular URL-shortening tools may be tricked into a false sense of security thinking they know and trust that brand already.
What you can do: Sites like TrueURL can safely reveal the end destination of a shortened link; however, this solution doesn’t scale and isn’t viable for mobile devices. Some artificial intelligence-based solutions stop phishing messages based on context, not just the presence of a malicious URL alone. By analyzing the link along with looking at contextual data, machine learning can prevent mobile phishing attempts no matter which URL shortener is used.
Malicious Apps
Mobile phishing attacks don’t always come to you; sometimes you seek them out yourself—through fraudulent mobile apps you download under the mistaken belief they’re legitimate.
Cybercriminals distribute these malicious apps by making them available on Apple’s App Store, the Google Play Store and other official app stores. As data captured in our latest trends report reveals, almost a third of all cyberattacks in the financial services sector during the second quarter of 2021 came from fraudulent banking apps—increasing 66% during a 90-day period.
Many of these malicious mobile apps fool users into entering login information. But some may ask for overarching permissions or, in some cases, take control of your phone to steal all kinds of sensitive information.
A common technique is known as a screen overlay attack, which uses multiple transparent layers to trick users into running malware or giving the app unneeded permissions. Some overlays secretly record and send snapshots of your screen back to the attacker, allowing them to identify contacts, usernames, and potentially passwords.
For example, a bad actor can launch a screen overlay that looks exactly like your banking app. When you enter your credentials, that information is sent to the attacker before you’re quickly redirecting back to your real banking app. This same scenario can be applied to customer loyalty programs, employee login portals, time-tracking apps, and more.
What you can do: Enterprise companies should leverage artificial intelligence to stop attackers from impersonating their brands on app stores. AI-powered services like ours scour dozens of app stores daily and launch takedown requests to protect your customers and brand image—automatically.

They can also employ services such as Outseer FraudAction, our cyberattack monitoring and takedown service, which proactively hunts down and works to remove phishing sites and phony social media pages before they can cause serious damage to their customers, suppliers, or other consumers and businesses.
Smishing/SMS spoofing
Smishing, or SMS spoofing, exploits text messaging to trick users into clicking malicious links. Smishing attacks targeting a company’s employees are often an overlooked part of cybersecurity and can be challenging to detect.
Smishing campaigns can even impersonate C-level staff within an organization to trick other employees into sending sensitive information, installing malware, or making a fraudulent wire transfer. Smishing messages often send the victim to a fake login page to steal their data or silently install spyware onto the phone.
Below is an example of a smishing attack attempting to impersonate a mobile operator:
What you can do: Educate staff on the dangers of smishing and create procedures for conducting wire transfers and sending sensitive information. Be wary of typos and misspellings (see example above). Enable two-factor authentication on employee accounts to prevent attackers from logging in with any stolen credentials.
For enterprises, consider leveraging artificial intelligence to monitor your employees’ web traffic. AI applies machine-learning analysis to proactively monitor and block phishing sites accessed by employees via both mobile or desktop.
But what about your customers and others who may fall victim? Here again, our solution can help. The experts in our Anti-Fraud Command Center use AI and other tools to continuously monitor the threat landscape to shut down sites that impersonate your brand—regardless of whether the phishing messages sent to recipients were an email or a text message.
Tiny URLs
TinyURL is one of many shortening tools that helps users send shorter mobile-friendly links. While the service is legitimate, it’s also used by scammers to hide malicious links. The tool works by taking a long URL and replacing it with a shorter one. When the user clicks the short URL, it redirects to the original.
For instance, this URL—
hxxps://fakewebsite.ru/spyware/a212/x/installer.exe
would look like this—
hxxps://tinyurl.com/2021Q1Report
The challenge here is that URL-shortening tools serve a real purpose, but they are misused by cybercriminals. Fraudsters can customize shortened URLs to contain a brand name or make links seem like they are part of an attachment.
While a majority of URL shorteners attempt to monitor and stop abuse, many phishing attacks slip through the cracks. Fraudsters use chains of multiple URL redirects to evade detection from firewalls and link-shortening platforms. Users who recognize popular URL-shortening tools may be tricked into a false sense of security thinking they know and trust that brand already.
What you can do: Sites like TrueURL can safely reveal the end destination of a shortened link; however, this solution doesn’t scale and isn’t viable for mobile devices. Some artificial intelligence-based solutions stop phishing messages based on context, not just the presence of a malicious URL alone. By analyzing the link along with looking at contextual data, machine learning can prevent mobile phishing attempts no matter which URL shortener is used.
Malicious Apps
Mobile phishing attacks don’t always come to you; sometimes you seek them out yourself—through fraudulent mobile apps you download under the mistaken belief they’re legitimate.
Cybercriminals distribute these malicious apps by making them available on Apple’s App Store, the Google Play Store and other official app stores. As data captured in our latest trends report reveals, almost a third of all cyberattacks in the financial services sector during the second quarter of 2021 came from fraudulent banking apps—increasing 66% during a 90-day period.
Many of these malicious mobile apps fool users into entering login information. But some may ask for overarching permissions or, in some cases, take control of your phone to steal all kinds of sensitive information.
A common technique is known as a screen overlay attack, which uses multiple transparent layers to trick users into running malware or giving the app unneeded permissions. Some overlays secretly record and send snapshots of your screen back to the attacker, allowing them to identify contacts, usernames, and potentially passwords.
For example, a bad actor can launch a screen overlay that looks exactly like your banking app. When you enter your credentials, that information is sent to the attacker before you’re quickly redirecting back to your real banking app. This same scenario can be applied to customer loyalty programs, employee login portals, time-tracking apps, and more.
What you can do: Enterprise companies should leverage artificial intelligence to stop attackers from impersonating their brands on app stores. AI-powered services like ours scour dozens of app stores daily and launch takedown requests to protect your customers and brand image—automatically.

Money Mule Accounts: We Need to Shut Them Down | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/money-mule-accounts-we-need-to-shut-them-down,2025-09-22,"Money Mule Accounts: We Need to Shut Them Down
Money mules fuel scams and account takeovers. UK data shows how banks and fintechs must act faster to detect, block, and stop money mule accounts.
This article is about money mules in the UK, but it is probably representative of any country. So, listen up. Money mules are one of the biggest reasons that transnational organized crime is successful in account takeovers (unauthorized transaction) and consumer scams (authorized transactions). Banks, credit unions, fintechs, and Banking-as-a Service solutions are generally weak when it comes to detecting, blocking and removing money mules. And in some countries, in the interest of preventing debanking of the vulnerable and the young, money mule accounts are not even shut down.
In August, the Financial Times reported: “More than 225,000 people (in the UK) were identified as ‘money mules’ for letting criminals use their accounts to launder funds last year”. The FT story went on to report: “The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it recognized the scale of the challenge in tacking the fast-growing problem of money mules and their pivotal role in enabling the rise of fraud (in the UK)—which rose to a record 45 percent of all UK crime in the year to March.” The FCA also said the “largest UK banks closed 226,957 money mule accounts . . . up from 184,935 a year earlier.”
And with all of these closures, there are probably still hundreds of thousands of undetected money mule accounts waiting to receive/move fraud and scam money.
To help provide more analysis to this issue of money mule accounts, the UK’s Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) just released a report, Following the Fraud: The Role of Money Mules. The authors, Kathryn Westmore and Allison Owen, were given money mule data by Lloyds Bank from June 17 2024 – August 11 2024 for this analysis. The data is based on money mule accounts at Lloyds Bank.
One of the first things that was identified was that as the money left the Lloyds’ money mule accounts, the money transferred to a few other financial institutions. In fact, RUSI reported: “38% of the payments by total value went to just three banks/ payment firms, with 20% of all payments by total value going to one single firm. This firm also received the highest number of payments from money mule accounts. These three institutions can be characterized as digital financial institutions, offering banking and money transfer services via apps and online banking.” RUSI also reported that that “over 450 (10%) of the payments identified from mule accounts went to Banking-as-a-Service providers—a disproportionate share compared with the overall share of Faster Payments to these services.”
In 2024, the Payment Systems Regulator detected a similar issue with a concentration of money mule accounts in smaller receiving banks and payment firms and also more activity in certain larger receiving banks (directed PSPs) in 2022–23. Charts 1 and 2 show the PSR assessment. Note: non-directed PSPs are smaller financial organizations.
Chart 1 – Value of APP scams received per £ millions of transactions Non-directed PSPs
Chart 2 – Value of APP scams received per £ million of transactions Directed PSPs
The PSR September 2024 consultation document also showed “that non-directed PSPs accounted for just over 8% of all Faster Payments made in 2023, but received 53% of all fraudulent transactions,” There has not been an update by the PSR since 2024, but it seems clear that some financial institutions may be still be weak at eliminating money mule accounts.
An obvious issue with the bank customer becoming complicit in making accounts available for money muling is highlighted by this quote in the Financial Times article. Ben Donaldson, managing director for economic crime at UK Finance said “many money mules were tricked or coerced into it without knowing it is a crime for which they can be imprisoned, even though few are convicted. I don’t think we can say all mules are victims but certainly many mules are victims.”
So, there are two key issues: 1) a certain number of banks need to be much better at detecting money mule accounts, and 2) how to deal with customers (maybe the young and foolish, maybe victims of scams themselves, and maybe those looking for fast money) who make their accounts available.
The RUSI report also identified the age of the mule accounts, which supports the ‘selling of accounts’. “20% of known money mule accounts were older than five years, with the majority (about 60%) being older than one year.” The ‘older’ aspect of these money mule accounts is symptomatic of the current customers selling the use of their accounts. This can make it more difficult to detect money mule accounts.
Another interesting observation is the short amount of time the money stays in the money mule account. The RUSI study showed: “nearly 28% left the account within 15 minutes and a further 25% left within an hour. Less than 15% of the money remained within the accounts after 24 hours.” This highlights the need for strong anomaly detection on inbound transactions so that suspicious money mule transactions can be identified and a hold can be quickly placed on the account to prevent the funds from moving. The UK has laws that allow suspicious transactions to be held. Other countries may need to add such ‘immediate hold’ laws.
Part of the money mule control should also be looking at fast exfiltration from the account. The RUSI report shows money can exfiltrate from the money mule account via transfer to another bank account, via ATM cash withdrawal and via debit card transaction. Figure 1 from the RUSI report contains detail of the exfiltration activity.
Figure 1 – Share of Payments Out of Money Mule Accounts, by Types
Another interesting point is the large amount of small dollar transactions exfiltrating from the money mule account. The average payment amount was £532. And the average debit card transaction was £107. This is consistent with reports that one-quarter to one-third of APP scam losses are less than £100. These small amounts will be more difficult/problematic for anomaly detection systems to pick up.
Actions to Take from the RUSI Money Mule Study
This report can help a financial institution undertake a strong money mule management program. Here are some of the key data points to take into account when building this program.
- Any account, regardless of the age, can be a money mule account. Current customers are being solicited to share their accounts for a fee. When the economy is tough, this can be enticing.
- Money mule activity is not just about large dollars. In fact, as this study shows much of the transaction activity is low amounts, around £1-500. How to deal with a high volume of small amounts can make the money mule solution more difficult. And a volume of small amount transactions into a mule account may look more normal.
- When analyzing the outbound activity of a suspect account, look at receiving bank to see if it is anomalous (e.g. many transactions from multiple accounts going to a new fintech or to a small receiving bank). Also take into account the other ways to exfiltrate the money (wire, debit card, ATM) as part of the outbound analysis).
- Because the money leaves the money mule account quickly, it is important to be able to complete a quick risk assessment of the inbound transactions.
- Track and report the accounts the money is transferred to from your bank to the next receiving bank (outbound from your money mule account to a new money mule account). This is valuable information for FIs.
A special thanks to Lloyds Bank and RUSI for providing the money mule data and the analysis. It helps to provide some keen insight to money mule accounts and the associated money movement. An interesting follow up for RUSI would be to analyze how long a money mule account was active and how many times it was used as a money mule account before it was shut down. This report also highlights how if there was more data sharing between financial institutions, we could help to weaken the value of money mules as a way to stop account takeovers and scams.",,"account takeover, fraud, scam",3,2025-09-22,"Money Mule Accounts: We Need to Shut Them Down | Outseer.

Navigating Malaysia’s Financial Crossroads: Balancing Early Pension Access and Pension-Backed Loans While Mitigating Fraud Vulnerabilities | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/navigating-malaysias-financial-crossroads,2023-10-08,"Navigating Malaysia’s Financial Crossroads: Balancing Early Pension Access and Pension-Backed Loans While Mitigating Fraud Vulnerabilities
In our continued exploration of the evolving financial landscape in Malaysia, we delve into an intricate facet that has garnered significant attention: the intersection of early pension access and its utilization as collateral for loans. As Malaysia seeks innovative solutions to address economic challenges, a new opportunity arises—one that could empower individuals while simultaneously exposing them to new vulnerabilities. In this blog, we dissect the complexities of utilizing pensions as loan collateral and the imperative for financial institutions to safeguard consumers in this evolving paradigm.
Expanding the Scope: Early Pension Access for Financial Flexibility
As Malaysia responds to shifting economic dynamics, it has extended citizens the option to access their pensions early. This approach aims to provide individuals with enhanced financial flexibility, allowing them to leverage their pension funds for critical life decisions such as dealing with unforeseen emergencies. While this expansion of pension usage options holds potential benefits, it also opens a door to intricate challenges that require careful consideration.
Following this, in March 2023, instead of continuing the previous approach, new proposals (effective April 7 2023) enable Malaysians to borrow from banks, using their pension savings as collateral, with an age requirement of 40 and older. Discussions on a potential phase 2 could expand this to under 40s, further broadening the potential pool of scam targets.
Unlocking Possibilities, Unveiling Vulnerabilities
While early pension access empowers individuals to make significant financial decisions, it simultaneously exposes them to new avenues of risk. Utilizing pension funds as collateral for loans, introduces a delicate balance between securing a future and compromising it. The allure of immediate financial relief might eclipse the potential long-term consequences of tying pensions to loan obligations.
A Two-Pronged Vulnerability: Scams and Financial Fragility
The convergence of early pension access and loan collateralization creates a dual vulnerability. On one hand, individuals might find themselves susceptible to scams that promise swift financial gains, leveraging the prospect of early pension funds. On the other, the financial fragility induced by loan obligations could inadvertently lead individuals to hasty decisions, rendering them more likely to fall victim to fraudulent schemes promising easy solutions to their debt.
Financial Institutions: Guardians of Consumer Well-Being
In this evolving landscape, the onus falls heavily on financial institutions to be vigilant guardians of consumer well-being. As individuals explore early pension access and loan options, institutions must step up their efforts to educate, protect, and prevent. A comprehensive approach to consumer protection involves:
- Transparent Education: Financial institutions should provide clear and comprehensive education on the risks and benefits of utilizing pensions as collateral. This enables individuals to make informed decisions aligned with their long-term financial goals.
- Robust Risk Assessment: Before offering loans tied to pension funds, institutions must conduct thorough risk assessments. This entails evaluating the borrower’s ability to manage loan repayments without jeopardizing their future financial security.
- Proven Fraud Prevention: Just as in our previous discussion on fraud prevention, institutions must leverage proven technologies such as Outseer’s Fraud Manager to detect and prevent scams. Behavioral analytics, transaction monitoring, and AI-driven algorithms play a pivotal role in safeguarding consumers.

Navigating Malaysia’s Financial Crossroads: Balancing Early Pension Access and Pension-Backed Loans While Mitigating Fraud Vulnerabilities
In our continued exploration of the evolving financial landscape in Malaysia, we delve into an intricate facet that has garnered significant attention: the intersection of early pension access and its utilization as collateral for loans. As Malaysia seeks innovative solutions to address economic challenges, a new opportunity arises—one that could empower individuals while simultaneously exposing them to new vulnerabilities. In this blog, we dissect the complexities of utilizing pensions as loan collateral and the imperative for financial institutions to safeguard consumers in this evolving paradigm.
Expanding the Scope: Early Pension Access for Financial Flexibility
As Malaysia responds to shifting economic dynamics, it has extended citizens the option to access their pensions early. This approach aims to provide individuals with enhanced financial flexibility, allowing them to leverage their pension funds for critical life decisions such as dealing with unforeseen emergencies. While this expansion of pension usage options holds potential benefits, it also opens a door to intricate challenges that require careful consideration.
Following this, in March 2023, instead of continuing the previous approach, new proposals (effective April 7 2023) enable Malaysians to borrow from banks, using their pension savings as collateral, with an age requirement of 40 and older. Discussions on a potential phase 2 could expand this to under 40s, further broadening the potential pool of scam targets.
Unlocking Possibilities, Unveiling Vulnerabilities
While early pension access empowers individuals to make significant financial decisions, it simultaneously exposes them to new avenues of risk. Utilizing pension funds as collateral for loans, introduces a delicate balance between securing a future and compromising it. The allure of immediate financial relief might eclipse the potential long-term consequences of tying pensions to loan obligations.
A Two-Pronged Vulnerability: Scams and Financial Fragility
The convergence of early pension access and loan collateralization creates a dual vulnerability. On one hand, individuals might find themselves susceptible to scams that promise swift financial gains, leveraging the prospect of early pension funds. On the other, the financial fragility induced by loan obligations could inadvertently lead individuals to hasty decisions, rendering them more likely to fall victim to fraudulent schemes promising easy solutions to their debt.
Financial Institutions: Guardians of Consumer Well-Being
In this evolving landscape, the onus falls heavily on financial institutions to be vigilant guardians of consumer well-being. As individuals explore early pension access and loan options, institutions must step up their efforts to educate, protect, and prevent. A comprehensive approach to consumer protection involves:
- Transparent Education: Financial institutions should provide clear and comprehensive education on the risks and benefits of utilizing pensions as collateral. This enables individuals to make informed decisions aligned with their long-term financial goals.

New NIST Identity Proofing and Authentication ‘Bible’ Out | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/new-nist-identity-proofing-and-authentication-bible-out,2025-08-06,"New NIST Identity Proofing and Authentication ‘Bible’ Out
In August 2025, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has come out with its new standards around authentication and identity proofing. In NIST’s own words:
“These guidelines cover the identity proofing, authentication, and federation of users (e.g., employees, contractors, or private individuals) who interact with government information systems over networks.”
If you are a fraud fighter in any country, this is your go to document to understand the latest in guidance around identity proofing and authentication. NIST has been putting out these documents for several decades. It is probably the best open source for obtaining this unbiased information. NIST is often the first one to call out issues with existing identity proofing and authentication controls. Although these guidance documents are released maybe only every four years, they are packed with the ‘whys’ something must change.
The Four Documents
The first document is NIST SP 800-63-4 Digital Identity Guidelines. This document “describes the digital identity models, risk assessment methodologies and processes for selecting assurance levels for identity proofing, authentication and federation.”
The second document is NIST SP 800-63A-4 Identity Proofing and Enrollment. This document provides “requirements for identity proofing and the remote or in-person enrolment of applicants.” This includes details on the Identity Assurance Levels (IAL) which are used to “convey the degree of confidence that the subject’s claimed identity is their real identity.”
The third document is NIST SP 800-63B-4 Authentication and Authenticator Management. This document provides “requirements for authentication processes that can be used at each of the three AALs (Authentication Assurance Levels), including choice of authenticators.” The AALs levels describe the strength of the authentication.
The fourth document is NIST SP 800-63C-4 Federation and Assertions. This document provides the “requirements on the use of federated identity architectures.” This is more for “the conveyance of identity and authentication information across a set of networked systems.” Unless you are focused on networked systems, you do not need to read this document.
Why is Identity Proofing and Authentication So Important in 2025?
Most financial institutions are using identity proofing and authentication solutions that can be 5–15 years old. Massive new threats to identity proofing and authentication have been introduced by the fraudsters, often sophisticated organized crime or even nation-states. Just think of the new fraudster capabilities from GenAI in the past two years, including agent bots, ability to generate good counterfeit driver’s licenses and passports, ability to defeat liveness testing, better social engineering, etc. Some of these new threats include bypassing multi-factor authentication. In fact, in the UK, the Royal United Services Institute considers “fraud as a national security concern.” A critical amount of fraud originates around weak identity proofing and authentication.
These new threats can make your identity proofing and authentication control stack quite weak.
To select new identity proofing and authentication controls requires a solid framework to help assess what are the critical requirements to mitigate the existing threats. The NIST documents really help solve this need. It took a while for me to find these ‘back in the day’, but once I did, they stayed by my side. It helped to explain to management why our current controls needed updating and the risk if we did not update. As an example, NIST was the first security entity to say stop using OTP email (very insecure) and really consider upgrading away from OTP email (too easy to spoof and the telecom environment was never meant for authentication security). Most financial institutions, and many others, still use OTP, even with these warnings.
What are Examples of What Is Contained in These NIST Guidelines
To help you understand the value of the documents, I will include several really good examples of what you will find in these documents.
Identity Proofing
There is a really good section on threats to identity proofing which include
- Impersonation
- False or fraudulent representation
- Social engineering attacks
- Infrastructure attacks
This section contains examples of these threats and suggested mitigations. Section 3.14 of 800.63A discusses a critical attack vector mitigation, the Presentation Attack Detection (PAD). PAD is automated determination of a presentation attack which interferes with the operation of the biometrics identity proofing.
There is a section of fraud checks that should take place, including:
- Check for recent SIM swaps, and length of time since phone service was activated, on the phone number used as part of the identity process.
- Incorporate device fingerprinting checks to protect against scaled and automated attacks and enrollment duplication.
When confirmation codes are used as part of validating enrollment data, the document provides specifics to the length (minimum 6 digits numeric) and when the code should expire (based on how the code is delivered -e.g. 10 minutes if sent to a validated phone)
There is a section that addresses customer experience to ensure the identity process does not cause customer experience issues.
Authentication
For beginners, the document explains the basics of authenticators:
- Something you know (a password)
- Something you have (a device)
- Something you are (a fingerprint or other biometric)
It cautions that a biometric cannot be used by itself for authentication.
The document explains cryptographic keys and how they can be used. This is a critical component with FIDO authenticators (also discussed in this document).
You often hear of the need for a ‘phishing-resistant’ authenticator to help mitigate phishing attacks and credential theft. Well, Section 3.2.5 of 800-63B will help you understand what ‘phishing-resistant ‘ means and how to make sure you add this control as part of your authenticator solutions.
There is a good section describing Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL). First is the definition of the three levels:
- AAL1 provides basic confidence the person controls an authenticator
- AAL2 provides high confidence the person controls one or more authenticators
- AAL3 provides very high confidence that the claimant controls authenticators that are bound to the subscriber account.
There is a description of the suggested authenticators for each level and why there may be different levels, even in the same application. See table from the NIST guidance.
This detailed discussion of Authenticator Assurance Levels and types of authenticators is especially important for EU financial institutions assessing how they will comply with the upcoming PSD3 regulations. Also, articles on PSD3 discuss how financial institutions must include consideration for the vulnerable : “(Strong Customer Authentication) SCA methods must now include authentication ways for vulnerable customers such as the elderly or people with disabilities who don’t rely solely on smartphone access.”
There is a good description of a very detailed point called ‘syncable authenticators’. This where the customer wants to copy the authenticator secret to additional devices. This can be key for customer usability.
There is another good discussion on considering offering multiple authenticators for your customer base. ‘One-size’ authenticator for all customers is no longer a best practice. One key point is to “consider authenticators from the users’ perspective.”
The NIST standards also bring up the important point of “continuous session monitoring.” Section 5.3 of 800-63B talks about the characteristics that can be included, such as behavioral biometrics, device and browser characteristics, usage patterns and velocity.
There is also a threat section on authenticator risks, including device theft, phishing, social engineering, authentication fatigue, unauthorized binding and device sold with keys included.
Final Thoughts
This is a free set of security documents from the US government. It is your primer education on identity proofing and authentication for financial institutions, eCommerce, and more. Read them at your own pace. Print them off and highlight and mark them up. It will be like an old novel you really liked.

New Zealand Government Established Anti-Scam Alliance | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/new-zealand-government-established-anti-scam-alliance,2025-07-16,"New Zealand Government Established Anti-Scam Alliance
On July 10, 2025, The New Zealand government announced the creation of the New Zealand Anti-scam Alliance. This comes on the heels of the New Zealand Bankers Association announcement in April 2025 “updating the Code of Banking Practice for the countries banks to better protect customers from scammers.” According to the government press release, Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Scott Simpson says:
“Up until this point New Zealand’s anti-scam efforts have developed in an ad-hoc way and suffered from a lack of coordination. We frequently hear that real-time information on scams is sourced from different areas across government and the private sector, making for a fragmented, and often, slow response.
“The Alliance addresses this by establishing a formal structure for government agencies, banks, telecommunications companies, digital platforms sectors, and consumer groups to share data about scams and shut them down in real-time.”
The Alliance issued its first report. Within the report, the Alliance listed four key objectives:
- Collaboration
- Disruption
- Education and Awareness
- Voluntary Codes
With collaboration, the plan is to increase data sharing between the public and private sector. Following the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange (AFCX) model would be a good start. Maybe they could share part of the AFCX structure. Plus, this objective focuses on better coordination between the members.
With disruption, the Alliance wants to “tackle scammers at scale by uniting national efforts across and between Government, law enforcement, not-for-profit organizations, regulators and the private sector.” The Alliance also wants to engage with key international organizations.
With education and awareness, the Alliance wants to help businesses educate consumers. And also provide direct education to consumers.
With voluntary codes, the government wants the industry bodies to establish “voluntary sector codes which set standards for the prevention, detection of and response to scams.”
The report showed a list of current members and where they will participate.
The Alliance will finalize its work plan by December 2025.
So, how well will this Alliance work? It will take a ‘strong hand’ by the New Zealand government to make this Alliance effective. Singapore and the UK governments come to minds as best examples of governments, with a ‘strong and firm hand’, driving the scam loss curve down (yes, Singapore scam losses rose in 2024, but it was a small number of large losses that caused the increase in scam losses). These governments, including their regulators, have effectively required banks to add critical controls to help reduce consumer scams. The UK also has the Online Safety Act legislation for digital platforms and Singapore added telco controls, along with bank controls, to reduce phishing losses. Can the New Zealand government match that action?
New Zealand has chosen a non-legislative approach to solve the consumer scam problem. The banks, telcos and digital platforms need to add controls to prevent 1) scams from starting and 2) stop the money leaving the financial institution. To stop the scams from starting requires digital platforms to quickly remove any bogus ads and websites. The digital platforms need to better vet their customers. Dating sites need a real KYC effort to remove scammers.
To stop the money leaving the financial institution, the New Zealand banks need more than their current five voluntary scam controls. As an example, the banks need to commit to strong money mule management and have strong controls around account opening. All of these controls do not need to be part of the banks’ existing voluntary scam reimbursement program. Put in strong controls to reduce consumer scams independent of reimbursement.
Effective data sharing amongst the participants in imperative. Singapore is one to follow with its COSMIC data sharing program. Maybe the GASA Global Signal Exchange can help in New Zealand. And of course, the Australian AFCX program should be looked at.
From a consumer side in New Zealand, there is already concern about the short list of voluntary bank controls to help reduce consumer scams. I asked Janine Starkes, consumer advocate and writer for two New Zealand newspapers, what she thought of the new Alliance. She said: “New Zealand is infamous in the local market for the protection of Aussie banks, allowing them to write their own rules and avoid liability in key areas (such as receiving bank scam liability). The scam alliance is an extension of this.” She also added: “This alliance stands in stark contrast to our Australian neighbors who have mandates and fines – the same banks operate in both markets.”
This Alliance needs to show it is serious about reducing scams. That means causing some pain for banks, telcos and digital platforms in order to get really meaningful controls.
The New Zealand Post said: “The Government has unveiled a public-private ‘alliance’ to fight scams, and among its aims is to get Apple, Discord, Google, Meta, Snap, TikTok, Twitch, X and Yahoo to sign up to a voluntary anti-scam code.” The government has to prove it can get these digital platforms on board.
Final Thoughts
I want the New Zealand model to be a winning model. It has the potential to be one of the best. Part of my measure of the Alliance’s success will be consumer groups saying scam losses are dropping and the banks, telecoms digital platforms are making a difference in this fight. We are up against transnational organized crime and we have to fight back tough. I thought Singapore hit hard with its recent “if we think the customer is in a scam, just block their account.” That is a hammer, but the customer still has his money. Some customers won’t like that. There will also be things banks, telcos and digital platforms won’t like, if the New Zealand government manages the Alliance correctly. And that is ok. We need to save our consumers from losing their life savings. We need to play hard ball! Maybe New Zealanders would say “Kia Kaha.” Go Kiwis!!",,"phishing, scam",2,2025-07-16,"New Zealand Government Established Anti-Scam Alliance | Outseer.

“Up until this point New Zealand’s anti-scam efforts have developed in an ad-hoc way and suffered from a lack of coordination. We frequently hear that real-time information on scams is sourced from different areas across government and the private sector, making for a fragmented, and often, slow response.
“The Alliance addresses this by establishing a formal structure for government agencies, banks, telecommunications companies, digital platforms sectors, and consumer groups to share data about scams and shut them down in real-time.”
The Alliance issued its first report. Within the report, the Alliance listed four key objectives:
- Collaboration
- Disruption
- Education and Awareness
- Voluntary Codes
With collaboration, the plan is to increase data sharing between the public and private sector. Following the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange (AFCX) model would be a good start. Maybe they could share part of the AFCX structure. Plus, this objective focuses on better coordination between the members.
With disruption, the Alliance wants to “tackle scammers at scale by uniting national efforts across and between Government, law enforcement, not-for-profit organizations, regulators and the private sector.” The Alliance also wants to engage with key international organizations.
With education and awareness, the Alliance wants to help businesses educate consumers. And also provide direct education to consumers.
With voluntary codes, the government wants the industry bodies to establish “voluntary sector codes which set standards for the prevention, detection of and response to scams.”
The report showed a list of current members and where they will participate.
The Alliance will finalize its work plan by December 2025.
So, how well will this Alliance work? It will take a ‘strong hand’ by the New Zealand government to make this Alliance effective. Singapore and the UK governments come to minds as best examples of governments, with a ‘strong and firm hand’, driving the scam loss curve down (yes, Singapore scam losses rose in 2024, but it was a small number of large losses that caused the increase in scam losses). These governments, including their regulators, have effectively required banks to add critical controls to help reduce consumer scams. The UK also has the Online Safety Act legislation for digital platforms and Singapore added telco controls, along with bank controls, to reduce phishing losses. Can the New Zealand government match that action?
New Zealand has chosen a non-legislative approach to solve the consumer scam problem. The banks, telcos and digital platforms need to add controls to prevent 1) scams from starting and 2) stop the money leaving the financial institution. To stop the scams from starting requires digital platforms to quickly remove any bogus ads and websites. The digital platforms need to better vet their customers. Dating sites need a real KYC effort to remove scammers.
To stop the money leaving the financial institution, the New Zealand banks need more than their current five voluntary scam controls. As an example, the banks need to commit to strong money mule management and have strong controls around account opening. All of these controls do not need to be part of the banks’ existing voluntary scam reimbursement program. Put in strong controls to reduce consumer scams independent of reimbursement.
Effective data sharing amongst the participants in imperative. Singapore is one to follow with its COSMIC data sharing program. Maybe the GASA Global Signal Exchange can help in New Zealand. And of course, the Australian AFCX program should be looked at.
From a consumer side in New Zealand, there is already concern about the short list of voluntary bank controls to help reduce consumer scams. I asked Janine Starkes, consumer advocate and writer for two New Zealand newspapers, what she thought of the new Alliance. She said: “New Zealand is infamous in the local market for the protection of Aussie banks, allowing them to write their own rules and avoid liability in key areas (such as receiving bank scam liability). The scam alliance is an extension of this.” She also added: “This alliance stands in stark contrast to our Australian neighbors who have mandates and fines – the same banks operate in both markets.”
This Alliance needs to show it is serious about reducing scams. That means causing some pain for banks, telcos and digital platforms in order to get really meaningful controls.
The New Zealand Post said: “The Government has unveiled a public-private ‘alliance’ to fight scams, and among its aims is to get Apple, Discord, Google, Meta, Snap, TikTok, Twitch, X and Yahoo to sign up to a voluntary anti-scam code.” The government has to prove it can get these digital platforms on board.
Final Thoughts
I want the New Zealand model to be a winning model. It has the potential to be one of the best. Part of my measure of the Alliance’s success will be consumer groups saying scam losses are dropping and the banks, telecoms digital platforms are making a difference in this fight. We are up against transnational organized crime and we have to fight back tough. I thought Singapore hit hard with its recent “if we think the customer is in a scam, just block their account.” That is a hammer, but the customer still has his money. Some customers won’t like that. There will also be things banks, telcos and digital platforms won’t like, if the New Zealand government manages the Alliance correctly. And that is ok. We need to save our consumers from losing their life savings. We need to play hard ball! Maybe New Zealanders would say “Kia Kaha.” Go Kiwis!!","new zealand government established anti-scam alliance | outseer. new zealand government established anti-scam alliance july 10, 2025, new zealand government announced creation new zealand anti-scam alliance. comes heels new zealand bankers association announcement april 2025 “updating code banking practice countries banks better protect customers scammers.” according government press release, commerce consumer affairs minister scott simpson says: “up point new zealand’s anti-scam efforts developed ad-hoc way suffered lack coordination. frequently hear real-time information scams sourced different areas government private sector, making fragmented, often, slow response. “the alliance addresses establishing formal structure government agencies, banks, telecommunications companies, digital platforms sectors, consumer groups share data scams shut real-time.” alliance issued report. report, alliance listed key objectives: - collaboration - disruption - education awareness - voluntary codes collaboration, plan increase data sharing public private sector. following australian financial crimes exchange (afcx) model good start. maybe share afcx structure. plus, objective focuses better coordination members. disruption, alliance wants “tackle scammers scale uniting national efforts government, law enforcement, not-for-profit organizations, regulators private sector.” alliance wants engage key international organizations. education awareness, alliance wants help businesses educate consumers. provide direct education consumers. voluntary codes, government wants industry bodies establish “voluntary sector codes set standards prevention, detection response scams.” report showed list current members participate. alliance finalize work plan december 2025. so, alliance work? ‘strong hand’ new zealand government make alliance effective. singapore uk governments come minds best examples governments, ‘strong firm hand’, driving scam loss curve (yes, singapore scam losses rose 2024, small number large losses caused increase scam losses). governments, including regulators, effectively required banks add critical controls help reduce consumer scams. uk online safety act legislation digital platforms singapore added telco controls, bank controls, reduce phishing losses. new zealand government match action? new zealand chosen non-legislative approach solve consumer scam problem. banks, telcos digital platforms need add controls prevent 1) scams starting 2) stop money leaving financial institution. stop scams starting requires digital platforms quickly remove bogus ads websites. digital platforms need better vet customers. dating sites need real kyc effort remove scammers. stop money leaving financial institution, new zealand banks need current voluntary scam controls. example, banks need commit strong money mule management strong controls account opening. controls need banks’ existing voluntary scam reimbursement program. strong controls reduce consumer scams independent reimbursement. effective data sharing participants imperative. singapore follow cosmic data sharing program. maybe gasa global signal exchange help new zealand. course, australian afcx program looked at. consumer new zealand, concern short list voluntary bank controls help reduce consumer scams. asked janine starkes, consumer advocate writer new zealand newspapers, thought new alliance. said: “new zealand infamous local market protection aussie banks, allowing write rules avoid liability key areas (such receiving bank scam liability). scam alliance extension this.” added: “this alliance stands stark contrast australian neighbors mandates fines – banks operate markets.” alliance needs reducing scams. means causing pain banks, telcos digital platforms order really meaningful controls. new zealand post said: “the government unveiled public-private ‘alliance’ fight scams, aims apple, discord, google, meta, snap, tiktok, twitch, x yahoo sign voluntary anti-scam code.” government prove digital platforms board. final thoughts want new zealand model winning model. potential best. measure alliance’s success consumer groups saying scam losses dropping banks, telecoms digital platforms making difference fight. transnational organized crime fight tough. thought singapore hit hard recent “if think customer scam, just block account.” hammer, customer money. customers won’t like that. things banks, telcos digital platforms won’t like, new zealand government manages alliance correctly. ok. need save consumers losing life savings. need play hard ball! maybe new zealanders say “kia kaha.” kiwis!!",0,1.0
Notable Fraud Trends in 2022: Insights from Outseer FraudAction’s Threat Intelligence Team | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/notable-fraud-trends-in-2022-insights-from-outseer-fraudactions-threat-intelligence-team,2023-05-05,"Notable Fraud Trends in 2022: Insights from Outseer FraudAction’s Threat Intelligence Team
As the Cyber Threat Intelligence Team Lead at Outseer, I have the privilege of leading a highly skilled team of multilingual experts who have immersed themselves in the world of fraud and cybercrime.
This blog shares the insights gained from monitoring hundreds of fraudster communication channels on the clear and dark web, engaging with fraudsters, and utilizing advanced research techniques. Let’s dive into the key fraud trends that shaped 2022.
Fraud Attack Distribution
Our analysis of attack type distribution, detected by Outseer FraudAction on behalf of customers, reveals a clear pattern: brand abuse remains the predominant attack vector, comprising over 65% of detected attacks. Phishing follows at 18%, while rogue mobile apps account for 12% and Trojans constitute the smallest portion at 5%.
Looking at the attack types distribution over four quarters, we observe a clear trend: brand abuse attacks are increasing while rogue mobile apps attacks are decreasing. This trend can be attributed to the varying levels of effort required by fraudsters to carry out each attack.
Brand abuse attacks are simple and fast, involving the creation of fake web pages or social media profiles. On the other hand, rogue mobile apps demand significant effort, including developing and uploading applications to various app stores. Consequently, if fraudsters succeed with brand abuse attacks, they have less incentive to invest in more complex attacks such as rogue mobile apps and Trojan attacks.
Notable Fraud Trends in 2022
1. Fraud Trends Emerging from the Russia-Ukraine War
The Russia-Ukraine War, which unfolded in early 2022, had significant consequences on the world’s economy and the realm of fraud. We observed several types of fraud directly related to the war. Fraudsters exploited the situation through donation scams, emotional posts, and 419 scams targeting individuals’ sympathies and willingness to help. Notably, state actors and skilled individuals were involved, using cybercrime as a weapon to harm Ukraine and deceive Westerners.
2. Synthetic Identity Fraud: A Growing Threat
Synthetic Identity Fraud emerged as one of the fastest-growing forms of identity theft in 2022. Fraudsters create synthetic identities by combining real and fake Personally Identifiable Information (PII), making it challenging to detect and combat. These identities are used to build credit histories that resemble those of individuals with limited or no credit history. Fraudsters utilize synthetic identities for various fraudulent activities, including obtaining loans, acting as mule accounts, and engaging in bank-related scams.
3. Android Banking Trojans Are Getting Smarter
The threat landscape witnessed the emergence of new Android Banking Trojans and updates to existing strains of banking malware in 2022. Developers continuously improved these Trojans, incorporating game-changing features and evading security solutions. What makes this trend particularly concerning is the availability of banking Trojans as a service known as Malware as a Service (MaaS), enabling even those with limited technical expertise to launch attacks. State actors from resource-constrained countries also capitalized on this market, outsourcing high-quality malware to carry out sophisticated cyber operations.
4. Check Fraud: A Surging Issue
Despite the increased adoption of electronic payment methods, check fraud remained a pressing concern in 2022. Fraudsters perfected their counterfeiting abilities and are actively trading stolen and counterfeited checks on underground markets. The ease of counterfeiting checks and changing bank policies, such as higher mobile check deposit limits, contributed to the growth of this trend. Check fraud can lead to significant financial losses, particularly when banks always book the loss.
5. Fake Ad Fraud: Exploiting Digital Ad Platforms
Digital ad platforms, such as Google ads, became popular among fraudsters for spreading phishing and malware campaigns in 2022. Victims were exposed to fake ads appearing on search engines and various websites. These ads appeared genuine, luring victims into clicking them, entering credentials, contacting phone numbers, or downloading malware. The accessibility and low costs associated with creating fake ads made digital ad platforms attractive attack vectors for fraudsters.

"Omicron Testing & Vax Scams Duping Victims Out of Money, Personal Data | Outseer",https://www.outseer.com/blog/omicron-testing,2022-01-17,"Omicron Testing & Vax Scams Duping Victims Out of Money, Personal Data
Don’t fall for these scams during a time of anxiety and illness. Keep reading to learn how to avoid being deceived.
Authorities on both sides of the Pond are issuing warnings about a sudden surge in Omicron testing and vaccination scams designed to steal money and sensitive personal information during a time of heightened anxiety.
Though hardly a newsflash, it’s painfully true: There really is no honor among thieves—even amid pandemic.
In the UK, bogus National Health Service-branded text messages and emails are urging recipients to apply to receive Omicron variant-specific PCR tests or risk being forced to isolate. Links within the malicious messages point to an expertly-crafted knock-off of an official NHS website requesting personal information that, among other things, could potentially be used to access bank account or commit insurance fraud.
Similar scams may be surfacing stateside in communities being hit hard by the highly-contagious variant of COVID-19. Just this past week, Florida state Attorney General Ashley Moody issued a consumer alert warning Floridians about potentially fraudulent COVID-19 testing sites, imposter health care workers at legitimate testing sites, and at-home testing scams. And the Oregon Department of Justice is investigating suspicious test sites cropping up around the state.
Meanwhile, the sheriff’s office in Hanover, VA, reports residents there have been receiving the exact same emails seen in the UK, pointing to those same NHS-branded phishing sites.
Don’t laugh. It’s certainly true that sending US citizens phishing emails pointing to phony British government websites suggests honor may not be the only thing lacking in some cybercriminal circles. But Omicron-themed attacks do fit with a larger, disturbingly-successful trend.
COVID-19: The Ultimate Cybercriminal Contagion
Cybercriminals are by their very nature opportunists. They’ll exploit any major news event or crisis to defraud individuals, businesses, and public organizations—the pandemic just happens to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity to prey on people’s fears. At every stage of the COVID timeline, fraudsters have been keen to leverage the “lure de jour.”
First, it was phishing emails impersonating the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and John Hopkins University. Next came fraudulent charitable organizations asking for donations, and ecommerce companies hawking medical masks, disinfectants and more—many targeting vulnerable senior citizens.
Through mid-December, nearly 657,000 US consumers reported $636.7 million in losses from COVID-19 scams, including many associated stimulus payments, since the beginning of the pandemic. And in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal has reported that individual swindlers and organized crime have pilfered $100 billion (yes, that’s with a “b”) from US government COVID-19 relief programs.
As demand for COVID-19 tests have skyrocketed with the emergence of Omicron, there has been a corresponding rise in fraudulent offers for rapid tests sold for home and even business use, and “more accurate tests” to be administered by healthcare professionals, according to AARP.
How to Avoid Continuously-Mutating Fraud Variants
The number of COVID scams has been running so high that the FTC has a special website dedicated to just to robocalls. And Palo Alto Networks reports that cybercriminals have registered tens of thousands of COVID-related web domains to use in spoof ads and phishing attacks designed to amass personal information to plant malware.
Among a growing list of signs of fraud to look out for:
- Pop-up testing sites asking for out-of-pocket payment to administer vaccines (COVID vaccines are free)
- Site volunteers who seem unformed or—a clear give-away—are unmasked during interactions with patients
- Websites, texts, or calls to “confirm” personal data to gain access to vaccines, grants, or stimulus checks
- Offers for teas, intravenous vitamin-C therapies or other remedies marketed as helping with symptoms
- Emails purporting to come from your company’s HR that click through to sites requiring corporate logins or personal information to “confirm vaccination status”
- Offers for fake vaccine cards to avoid having to actually get vaccinated
- Private companies requesting personal information for home testing kits
The list goes on and on. To protect yourself, ignore unsolicited messages and instead contact your healthcare provider directly with any questions. And businesses, public sector agencies, and other organizations seeking protection against getting impersonated in these attacks should source an all-inclusive cyber-intelligence & takedown service.
As the pandemic enters its third year, we’ve all learned that it’s impossible to know what new mutation will surface next. The only certainty is that fraudsters will be ready and waiting to exploit it.

When it comes to card-not-present transactions, there are several types of scams and threats that individuals, financial institutions, and businesses should be aware of.
- Phishing: Scammers send fraudulent emails or messages pretending to be legitimate organisations, tricking individuals into revealing their personal information, such as credit card details or login credentials.
- Identity Theft: Fraudsters steal personal information, such as names, addresses, and credit card numbers, with the intention of using them for unauthorised transactions.
- Account Takeover: Scammers gain unauthorised access to a person’s account and make fraudulent transactions without their knowledge or consent.
- Card Skimming: Criminals use devices to steal credit card information by capturing the card details when it is swiped or entered into compromised payment terminals or websites.
- Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Hackers intercept communication between the customer and the merchant, allowing them to eavesdrop, modify, or steal sensitive information during the transaction.
- Triangulation Fraud: Customers buy from genuine marketplaces, but scammers are fraudulently selling the items purchased fraudulently from another retailer.
- Card Testing: Fraudsters use automated scripts or software to test stolen credit card numbers on various websites to determine which ones are valid before using them for fraudulent purchases.
- Social Engineering: Scammers manipulate individuals through psychological tactics, persuading them to provide sensitive information or perform actions that benefit the fraudster.
Sometimes, as the Aite Faster Payments, Faster Fraud Report (May 2023) points out, the consumer is the weakest link as fraudsters have developed a tried-and-true playbook and have replicated this attack vector across multiple geographies.
Outseer has seen a significant increase in counterfeit text messages imitating legitimate banks or companies to not only steal consumer data but also even as far as installing malware/ransomware onto the consumer’s device. The type of messages being received by customers are designed to trigger the emotional response to act quickly, either leading to a benefit or risk if the customer was not to act. However, behind the scenes, this is all a front and is used as an incentive to push the customer into sharing information.
The banking, financial services, and insurance industry are directly affected by data breaches from other companies for example, Emma Sleep Company confirmed that it suffered a Magecart attack which enabled ne’er-do-wells to skim customers’ credit or debit card data from its website.
The Power of Outseer 3-D Secure ACS in Combating Card-Not-Present Fraud
Outseer 3-D Secure is a powerful solution that can make a significant difference in the ongoing battle against card-not-present fraud and scams. It provides the tools needed for card issuers to author and manage their 3DS screen text themselves and tailor the text and screens shown based on different types of payments.
Originally this was used to write challenge screens in different languages and to customise the screen text to the needs of each issuer’s own UX requirements. However, the flexibility of Outseer 3DS enabling issuers to self-manage their screens is helping them find new ways to enhance the experience for cardholders and prevent even more fraud.
Customising 3DS Screen Text for Enhanced Cardholder Experience
As an example of a better cardholder experience, instead of a generic authentication screen for every transaction type, unique screens can be shown for different payment flows. For example, recurring payments are clearer with specific text outlining that it is a recurring payment.
Example Outseer 3-D Secure Screen for Recurring Transactions
The issuer receives transaction data in real-time, even the full EMV 3DS protocol data elements from the merchant are available for the issuer to process in real-time. This not only gives the issuer the ability to store EMV 3DS transaction data in an issuer data lake for their own BI analysis and reporting, or to consume EMV 3DS authentication data for more accurate authorisation decisions, but it also gives the issuer a wealth of data to make real-time decisions about the EMV 3DS transaction outcome and which screens should be shown to the cardholder.
Tailoring Screens for Different Payment Flow
For example, a quasi-cash transaction from a crypto merchant with Merchant Category Code (MCC) 6051 can be identified by the issuer in real-time, and the issuer can make the decision to show a cardholder a different challenge screen based on MCC code and/or merchant name describing the increased risk to the cardholder and remind the cardholder of the risk.
Example screen for a Crypto Transaction
Also, the authentication flow can be different based on real-time issuer decisions. For example, a merchant previously seen in scams could be triggered by the issuer to show an additional warning screen in a mobile app authenticator, it could ask the cardholder additional questions about the transaction – who are they paying, why are they paying, and are they being guided by someone to make the payment.
Example issuer app screen with additional scam warning
Introducing Delays for Increased Cardholder Awareness
Another approach is for the issuer to insert delays into the authentication process to force the cardholder to slow down, take a moment and think about what they are doing before completing the authentication. For example, an issuer using an SMS authentication method for specific higher-risk transactions could first send a warning message, followed a minute later with the challenge code.
Example delayed SMS
Empowering Issuers with Customised Challenge Screens for Heightened Cardholder Awareness and Fraud Prevention
Combining the proven accuracy of the Outseer Risk Engine with issuer real-time decisions allows issuers to tune the cardholder experience for specific scenarios. A generic authentication screen is not enough to combat scams and is not ideal for different payment flows. Showing the authentication screen too often leads to cardholders becoming too familiar with the challenge flow and becoming complacent about why that challenge screen is being used.
Enabling issuers to be able to select different types of challenge screens only when they match specific high-risk transaction criteria makes the cardholder more aware of their actions and the risk of the payment they are about to approve.

"Outseer Report: Brand Abuse Skyrockets 274%, Fraudulent Mobile Apps Proliferating | Outseer",https://www.outseer.com/blog/outseer-report-brand-abuse,2022-01-27,"Outseer Report: Brand Abuse Skyrockets 274%, Fraudulent Mobile Apps Proliferating
Want to learn about ‘brand abuse’? Read on to learn how it may be threatening your business and why the trend is growing.
A sharp rise in “brand abuse” scams could threaten your digital business strategies in 2022—and cost your company and its customers billions.
During the third quarter of 2021, the number of phishing sites, phony mobile apps, and fake social media pages impersonating brand-name companies jumped 274% on an annualized basis, according to our latest quarterly Fraud & Payments report.
Sometimes called “brand exploitation” or even “brandjacking,” brand abuse impersonations now figure into nearly half of all cyberattacks worldwide. It’s easy to see why. Ever the opportunists, fraudsters have capitalized on the dramatic shift to digital everything—working, shopping, learning, dating, gaming, and more—during the COVID-19 pandemic.
They’re hitting pay dirt, too. According to the Federal Trade Commission, consumer losses associated with brand abuse spiked 85% from October 2020 through September 2021. The price tag: More than $2 billion in the US alone.
As captured in our report, brand abuse played a role in 45% of all attacks detected by the Outseer FraudAction team during the third quarter of 2021. Yet as troubling as that may be, specific findings suggest impersonation scams could represent a costly risk to companies of every size and industry in the year ahead.
Immaculate Deceptions: How Fraudsters Abuse Your Brand
Perhaps it’s sham text messages and voicemails from Amazon or one of your company’s key vendors. It could be a bogus “blocked account alert” purporting to come from Chase. Maybe it’s a spurious social media page and site hawking counterfeit NFTs by someone posing as a celebrated artist or celebrity.
Whatever the case, they’re all designed to look like the real deal. And all are crafted to trick your customers, employees or other consumers and businesses into authorizing money transfers or revealing login credentials or other sensitive data. And it’s happening at an unprecedented rate.
Out of 56,000 fraud attacks Outseer identified from July through September of 2021, 14% involved phishing attacks through email or text message, even as the number of attacks involving Trojans deployed into corporate sites continued to decline.
While scams designed to deposit malware require resources and are tougher to monetize as corporate defenses harden, fraudsters are finding it’s far easier to hack the human mind using social engineering ploys that provoke anxiety or prod curiosity or desire.
According to data in our Q4 report, half of all “traditional” phishing attacks target consumers and businesses in the US, Spain, and South America. Three-quarters of these attacks are launched from hosting servers within the US. Of growing concern: the rising number of fraudulent social media pages and, most especially, rogue mobile apps.
In 2021, social media firms like Facebook and Twitter took down more than 1 billion fake profiles. And as captured in our own data, the number of fraudulent brand mobile apps available through legitimate app stores nearly doubled in just 90 days, and now account for nearly 40% of all fraud attacks.
Fighting Back Against Big Losses
For consumers who fall prey to these impersonations, the average loss is $1,000—though it can get distressingly higher.
When it’s a large business that’s victimized, these attacks can lead to an average $5 million in loss. When impersonation attacks lead to a data breach, it costs US-based companies another $9.05 million on average, per incident. And these are all before any regulatory fines, which can run as high as $487,000 or (much) more.
That’s just the start of it. Get impersonated, and your brand could take a hit to reputation and revenue as your customers and prospects grow wary of your legitimate digital marketing campaigns and channels. According to Forrester, lost customer trust and even heightened customer suspicion can impact a company’s revenue by 10% to 25% in a single year.
The situation is so dire that the FTC is now formalizing bans against impersonating businesses and government agencies after a recent Supreme Court ruling making it harder for authorities to recovery money for scam victims from the perpetrators.
Preventing brand abuse is complex and fast-moving. Organizations are advised to source fraud intelligence and cyberattack takedown services that monitor the web, app stores, and social media platforms 24/7 to detect and shut down brand impersonation rackets before they can cause serious financial and reputational damage.

Outseer Report: 59% of Fraudulent Banking Transactions Made Via Mobile App | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/outseer-report-fraudulent-banking,2022-03-29,"Outseer Report: 59% of Fraudulent Banking Transactions Made Via Mobile App
There are fresh signs a cybercriminal blitzkrieg may be coming to a mobile banking app near you. In fact, it’s already here. Today, nearly 60% of all fraudulent transactions in the banking sector now take place via mobile app, according to findings in Outseer’s latest quarterly Fraud & Payments Report.
As competition for banking customers heats up, the potential financial and reputational fallout could eclipse both shock and awe.
According to Forbes, mobile banking penetration has grown to encompass 95% of Gen Zers, 91% of Millennials, 95% of Gen Xers, 60% of Baby Boomers, and 27% of Seniors. As our own data bears out, three times as many digital transactions were facilitated through mobile banking apps (75%) during the third quarter of 2021 than mobile browsing (3%) and the desktop web (22%) combined.
The banking brand delivering the most speed and convenience can win big. Unfortunately, the bad guys got the memo. Between July and September 2021, Outseer researchers observed that fraudulent transactions made via mobile app rose more than 35% over levels seen during the fourth quarter of 2020. And there are no signs of slowing down.
Fraud & The Mobile Money Grab
Even without on-again, off-again, on-again threats of Russian cyberattacks in retaliation to U.S. support for Ukraine, the avenues for low-risk, high-reward fraud attacks are plentiful.
Take email and SMS scams designed to look like fraud alerts or past-due notices that fool recipients into entering login credentials on bogus bank sites. Or fraudulent banking and payment apps downloaded from trusted app stores and designed to do the same. Or banking Trojans like Escobar, which hijacks legitimate apps with overlays of fake bank login forms and even steals Google Authenticator codes to bypass two-factor authentication.
Thanks to scams like these and an endless stream of data breaches, logins and credit card numbers can be acquired for pennies on the dollar in dark web marketplaces.
Across all industries, card-not-present (CNP) fraud alone could lead to $17.3 billion in losses by 2023, according to the Aite-Novarica Group. Meanwhile, account takeover (ATO) contributes to as much as $16.9 billion in annual losses. And then there’s the use of stolen and synthetic identity data in account enrollment fraud, which is a $6 billion problem the FBI calls one of the fastest-growing forms of financial crime today.
According to Outseer’s data, the average loss to consumers who fall prey to these swindles in Q3, 2021 ranged from $2,089 for transactions originating from the mobile channel to $9,898 for those originating from the desktop web. But those figures can go much higher. And banks themselves can pay a hefty price as well.
Fraud Meets Friction: The High Cost to Bank Brands
According to surveys cited by SecurityBoulevard.com, 67% consumers who fall prey to fraud will switch banks as a result. And when word gets out through negative headlines or social media rants, the reputational damage can be costly. According to Forrester, lost customer trust and even heightened customer suspicion can impact a company’s revenue by 10% to 25% in a single year.
But as eMarketer points out, cranking up security measures to avoid that must be done judiciously. More than a third of customers bristle over ever-changing authentication measures. At a time when it costs 5X as much to find new customers than it does keep existing customers happy, the balance between preventing fraud while avoiding added friction can be a high-stakes tightrope act.
Educating bank customers about scams, the need for strong passwords, and enabling multifactor authentication can help. But FIs are advised to take a risk-based approach to authentication so that legitimate customers are able to conduct business without interference and step-up challenges can be reserved for only the small percentage of logins or transactions that warrant additional scrutiny.
In a digital banking battlefield marked by rising consumer expectations and increasingly-sophisticated cybercriminal attacks, a multilayered approach that includes these and other measures may be your safest path to victory.

The banking brand delivering the most speed and convenience can win big. Unfortunately, the bad guys got the memo. Between July and September 2021, Outseer researchers observed that fraudulent transactions made via mobile app rose more than 35% over levels seen during the fourth quarter of 2020. And there are no signs of slowing down.
Fraud & The Mobile Money Grab
Even without on-again, off-again, on-again threats of Russian cyberattacks in retaliation to U.S. support for Ukraine, the avenues for low-risk, high-reward fraud attacks are plentiful.
Take email and SMS scams designed to look like fraud alerts or past-due notices that fool recipients into entering login credentials on bogus bank sites. Or fraudulent banking and payment apps downloaded from trusted app stores and designed to do the same. Or banking Trojans like Escobar, which hijacks legitimate apps with overlays of fake bank login forms and even steals Google Authenticator codes to bypass two-factor authentication.
Thanks to scams like these and an endless stream of data breaches, logins and credit card numbers can be acquired for pennies on the dollar in dark web marketplaces.
Across all industries, card-not-present (CNP) fraud alone could lead to $17.3 billion in losses by 2023, according to the Aite-Novarica Group. Meanwhile, account takeover (ATO) contributes to as much as $16.9 billion in annual losses. And then there’s the use of stolen and synthetic identity data in account enrollment fraud, which is a $6 billion problem the FBI calls one of the fastest-growing forms of financial crime today.
According to Outseer’s data, the average loss to consumers who fall prey to these swindles in Q3, 2021 ranged from $2,089 for transactions originating from the mobile channel to $9,898 for those originating from the desktop web. But those figures can go much higher. And banks themselves can pay a hefty price as well.
Fraud Meets Friction: The High Cost to Bank Brands
According to surveys cited by SecurityBoulevard.com, 67% consumers who fall prey to fraud will switch banks as a result. And when word gets out through negative headlines or social media rants, the reputational damage can be costly. According to Forrester, lost customer trust and even heightened customer suspicion can impact a company’s revenue by 10% to 25% in a single year.
But as eMarketer points out, cranking up security measures to avoid that must be done judiciously. More than a third of customers bristle over ever-changing authentication measures. At a time when it costs 5X as much to find new customers than it does keep existing customers happy, the balance between preventing fraud while avoiding added friction can be a high-stakes tightrope act.
Educating bank customers about scams, the need for strong passwords, and enabling multifactor authentication can help. But FIs are advised to take a risk-based approach to authentication so that legitimate customers are able to conduct business without interference and step-up challenges can be reserved for only the small percentage of logins or transactions that warrant additional scrutiny.
In a digital banking battlefield marked by rising consumer expectations and increasingly-sophisticated cybercriminal attacks, a multilayered approach that includes these and other measures may be your safest path to victory.

Payment Fraud: What It Is & How To Prevent It | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/payment-fraud,2022-02-15,"Payment Fraud: What It Is & How To Prevent It
We give a detailed explanation of what payment fraud is, how it can affect your organization and your customers, and top strategies for preventing it.
What Is Payment Fraud?
Payment fraud occurs when someone uses misappropriated payment details to make unauthorized transactions in order to steal money or property.
Types of payment fraud include:
- CNP payment fraud
- Chargeback fraud (friendly fraud)
- Account takeover
- Account enrollment fraud
Most forms of financial fraud involve impersonation or identity fraud, accounting for as much as $56 billion in losses per year, according to the 2021 Identity Fraud Study from Javelin Strategy & Research. And there are no signs of slowing down. As more businesses utilize digital channels to serve their customers, fraudsters seek new ways to exploit them.
This can include scams designed to steal credit card, P2P payments, and other account information in order to make illicit transactions. It can also entail the use of compromised login credentials to hijack bank and payment accounts in account takeover (ATO) attacks—either directly or through the use of automated bots.
It can also entail so-called “friendly fraud” through which unscrupulous customers abuse “returnless refunds” and other forms of chargeback fraud to attain merchandise without having to pay for it.
Increasingly, it can also involve falsified account enrollment, where fraudsters use synthetic identity information to open bank, credit card, and new payment forms such as Buy Now, Pay Later accounts.
Examples of Payment Fraud
Below we’ll explore the different types of payment fraud, explain how the attack works, and what you can do to defend your business from it.
CNP Payment Fraud: A Growing Problem
Card-not-present (CNP) fraud has risen sharply during the ecommerce boom triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Aite-Novarica Group CNP fraud could lead to $17.2 billion in lost revenue annually. To mitigate this threat, financial services organizations, credit card companies, and others are layering in new defenses against CNP fraud, but with varying success.
For instance, confirming CNP transactions with the customer via text message has been a growing trend, especially when the amount being transacted is unusually high. In practice, however, this can create friction that can lead impatient consumers to abandon the purchase, never to return. As it stands now, as much as 88% of online shopping orders are abandoned, according to Statistica.
Knowing how CNP fraud works is vital to understanding how to stop it without creating friction for legitimate transactions.
Fraudsters carry out CNP fraud through the following methods:
- Engaging in phishing scams – CNP fraud often occurs through online phishing scams, where criminals create malicious clones of real websites that steal customer information. These phishing campaigns are usually spread via email, but they can also spread through text messages, fraudulent social media pages and rogue mobile apps.
- Facilitating fraudulent business purchases – This can also occur at restaurants where dishonest employees hand-copy credit card information before processing your transaction.
- Exploiting data compromised through data breaches – But by far the most common way fraudsters obtain stolen credit card information is via Dark Web marketplaces where the card and other personal information is harvested from data breaches.
You can prevent CNP fraud by doing the following:
- Require billing address (AVS) & CVV verification
- Take down phishing sites impersonating your brand to reduce credentials harvesting
- Implement solutions that leverage and enhance the EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS) payment authentication protocol
Chargeback Fraud (Friendly Fraud)
Chargeback fraud occurs when a customer initiates a chargeback through their bank for a product they already received. When this happens accidentally, for instance, if a customer forgot they placed the order, it is referred to as friendly fraud. Unfortunately in both cases, chargeback fraud cuts into profits through chargeback fees and chips away at inventory.
Fraudsters carry out chargeback fraud through the following methods:
- Claiming they never received the product – The customer keeps the product, then issues a chargeback stating they never received it.
- Claiming they never authorized the purchase – The customer orders the product, receives it, but then initiates a chargeback claiming they did not make the purchase.
- Simply forgetting they ordered the product – Sometimes customers forget they make purchases, especially if shipping is delayed, causing them to dispute the charge once they see it on their statement.
- Abusing “returnless refund” policies – Fraudsters or even everyday consumers exploit policies that allow them to receive a full refund for an item without having to return it, in order to save the business shipping and processing costs.
In one recent survey, 44% of merchants report experiencing return abuse of some kind in the last 12 months, and 66% say it’s getting worse. But preventing this form of payment fraud before it happens can be tricky.
New fraud detection methods can prevent chargeback fraud before the transaction is completed thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
You can prevent chargeback payment fraud by doing the following:
- Confirming all orders via email/text
- Reminding customers of recurring payments
- Applying frictionless transaction monitoring in your business
- Using recognizable transaction descriptions
Account Takeover
Criminals use account takeover attacks to commit payment fraud using payment details on file or stolen payment information. The price tag: As much as $16.9 billion per year. According to HelpNet Security, ATO attacks increased 307% between 2019 and 2021. This can be tough for businesses to spot because transactions are coming from a legitimate cardholder or customer account, when, in fact, it has been stolen.
Once inside the stolen account, attackers can transfer money, update billing information, and even set illegitimate beneficiaries.
Fraudsters steal customer accounts through the following methods:
- Sending phishing messages – Victims unknowingly log in to a malicious clone of a trusted website where attackers copy their account information.
- Installing malware – Spyware allows attackers to see the keystrokes and actions of a customer.
- Rogue mobile apps – The installation of fraudulent branded apps designed to fool victims into revealing login credentials increased 49% just within the third quarter of 2021.
- Credential stuffing – Criminals purchase entire databases of stolen account information on the dark web and then use software to test and validate passwords that haven’t been changed.
That last point is key. ATOs fueled by data breaches increased 850% between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021. With login credentials so readily available, the trick to stopping account takeover is to recognize fraudulent transactions and logins from legitimate accounts. One of the best ways to prevent this form of payment fraud is to use a fraud prevention system. These services use data science and machine learning to distinguish normal account behavior from fraudulent activity—no matter who is signed into the account.
You can prevent account payment fraud by doing the following:
- Offering two-factor authentication to your customers
- Preventing fraudulent logins with a fraud prevention system
- Setting login attempt limits to prevent credential stuffing
- Training staff to identify the signs of an account takeover
Account Enrollment Fraud
Increasingly, cybercriminal networks use small pieces of stolen identity information to stitch together fraudulent, or “synthetic” identities that can be used to open credit card, banking, BNPL, and other payment accounts, as well as apply for loans.
Synthetic identity fraud is a $6 billion problem that the FBI calls one of the fastest-growing forms of financial crime. In fact, the American Bankers Association reports the average synthetic identity profile is used to successfully steal between $81,000 and $97,000.
You can prevent synthetic identity fraud by doing the following:
- Use machine learning-based account enrollment fraud prevention solutions
- Verify each piece of new customer information during account registration.
- Automatically monitor all transactions for signs of fraud
- Keep up to date with identity screening best practices
- Use anti-fraud systems that leverage global data-sharing networks
- Apply extra scrutiny to account applicants using CPNs rather than an EIN or SSN.
Stopping Fraud, Not Transactions
Payment fraud and the myriad avenues for fraudsters to perpetrate it can feel overwhelming. But you don’t have to handle it alone.

Payment Fraud Detection: How to Detect & Prevent It | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/payment-fraud-detection,2022-04-05,"Payment Fraud Detection: How to Detect & Prevent It
Wondering about payment fraud detection? In this article, we’ll explain how payment fraud detection works and explore ways you can implement detection systems in your business.
What Is Payment Fraud Detection?
Payment fraud detection is the process of identifying attempts to make fraudulent transactions and preventing them from occurring. Forms of payment fraud can include the following and more:
- Card-Not-Present (CNP) Fraud
- Chargeback Fraud
- Account Takeover (ATO)
- Account Enrollment Fraud
Over the past few years, more businesses have shifted to eCommerce in the wake of COVID-19 to remain competitive and accessible to customers.
After swelling to $4.2 trillion in 2020, research from Outseer and Aite-Novarica Group estimates that total digital channel payments could hit $5.9 trillion by 2023. And that figure may grow if consumer enthusiasm for card-not-present (CNP)-enabled online and mobile purchases and popular payment options like Scan-and-Go, “invisible” payments, and Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) continue to intensify.
As it stands now, nearly 60% of consumers will choose a business with these or other forms of payment over a competitor that lacks them.
Unfortunately, fraudsters have taken full advantage of this shift. As digital channel sales have reached new heights over the past 18 months, so has payment fraud. Within the next two years, CNP fraud alone could lead to $17.2 billion in lost revenue annually. Throw in as much as $25.3 billion in loss due to chargeback fraud, and the financial damage starts to add up fast.
These attacks can quickly chip away at profits for merchants, credit card companies, and other payment processors.Payment fraud detection aims to identify fraudulent activities before transactions are made, without slowing down legitimate customer payments.
What Types of Attacks Does Payment Fraud Detection Prevent?
To better understand payment fraud detection, let’s look at a few examples of payment fraud attacks and how payment fraud detection can stop them.
Card-Not-Present (CNP) Fraud
Card-not-present fraud is committed when fraudsters use stolen credit card details without physical possession of the card. CNP fraud is among the most common forms of payment fraud as there are numerous techniques fraudsters can use to steal card details.
Cybercriminals often rely on phishing schemes to trick victims into entering their card details into a cloned version of a branded website. Fraudsters then make fraudulent purchases with this stolen information.
Data breaches are another common source for stolen card details. Even when a cardholder protects their information, attackers can steal their payment details from unsecured websites where their card was used. Fraudsters purchase such compromised credentials in bulk from dark web marketplaces and then use automated bots to test card details on vulnerable websites.
In both examples, the victim’s CVV is compromised, meaning CVV checks alone are not enough.
Payment fraud detection that employs the EMV® 3-D Secure protocol have proven to be remarkably effective and detecting and preventing payment fraud.
Today’s most robust 3DS-based solutions, for instance, analyze more than 100 different risk indicators to silently authenticate customers before a transaction even occurs. This enables merchants, issuers, and banks to deliver a fast, friendly checkout experience to legitimate customers while blocking fraudsters at the door.
Chargeback Fraud
Chargeback fraud occurs when a customer initiates a chargeback through their bank for a product they already received. When this happens by accident, it is referred to as “friendly fraud.” Sometimes customers can forget they made a purchase or forgot autopay was enabled.
No matter the intent, both scenarios result in a chargeback that refunds the customer and issues the business a chargeback fee. When fraudsters identify a vulnerable business, they can repeatedly target that company causing a wave of chargebacks.
Chargeback fees can range anywhere from $20 to $100, depending on the merchant’s agreement with their payment provider. Between acquisition costs, marketing, and transaction fees, chargebacks can leave businesses in the red on each transaction.
In one recent survey, 44% of merchants report experiencing return abuse of some kind in the last 12 months, and 66% say it’s getting worse. But preventing this form of payment fraud before it happens can be tricky.
Proven fraud detection methods can prevent chargeback fraud before the transaction is completed thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. By analyzing the behavior of the transaction history of the customer, merchants can filter out risky transactions that match the behavior of chargeback fraud.
Account Takeover
In account takeover (ATO) attacks, criminals use compromised login credentials to log into legitimate customer accounts and commit payment fraud using payment details on file or stolen credit card numbers. ATOs fueled by data breaches increased 850% between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021. As much as $16.9 billion is lost to this crime each year.
Cybercriminal organizations purchase entire databases of compromised login credentials and then use software to test and validate passwords that haven’t been changed. And in addition to email- and text-based phishing scams, the use of fraudulent branded apps designed to fool victims into revealing login credentials increased 49% just within the third quarter of 2021.
ATOs can be notoriously difficult to detect because transactions are coming from a legitimate cardholder or customer account. But it is possible. Bot detection solutions can recognize and block credentials stuffing attacks designed to infiltrate accounts. And modern fraud prevention solutions use data science and machine learning to distinguish normal account behavior from fraudulent activity—no matter who is signed into the account.
Account Enrollment Fraud
Fraudsters increasingly use a combination of stolen and fabricated data to create synthetic identities that can be used to open credit card, banking, BNPL, and other payment accounts, as well as apply for loans.
Synthetic identity fraud is a $6 billion problem that the FBI calls one of the fastest-growing forms of financial crime. In fact, the American Bankers Association reports the average synthetic identity profile is used to successfully steal between $81,000 and $97,000. The nature of this attack can leave merchants, creditors, and banks blindsided in a single transaction.
Payment fraud detection solutions that emphasize enrollment fraud prevention can identify and prevent synthetic identities from opening accounts from which they can defraud you or other companies.
By leveraging machine learning and data science combined with an ecosystem of identity verification partners, today’s most effective options bridge the gap between physical and digital identity to defeat fraud without negatively impacting the customer experience.
How Does Payment Fraud Detection Work?
Modern payment fraud detection leverages data science, machine learning, and statistical analysis to monitor transactions continuously and assess the relative risk associated with a transaction.
This can entail comparing dozens or even hundreds of pieces of transactional data to models of known fraud. The closer a transaction matches fraudulent behavior, the higher the risk score.
These risk scores are calculated before checkout or payment and only take a few fractions of a second. If there is enough information to authenticate the user, the transaction proceeds without delay. If the risk score suggests possible fraud, the customer is sent through a challenge flow to provide additional authentication.
Challenges typically include a one-time password sent via text, email, or biometric scan. This risk-based approach is designed to create as frictionless a flow as possible to avoid slowing down the transaction experience for legitimate customers while simultaneously preventing fraud.
Not Just Protecting the Bottom Line—Boosting It
Payment fraud detection is tough enough as it is, but there will never been a single, set-it-and-forget-it solution. The technologies businesses put in place must evolve as quickly as cybercriminal tactics do.

Payment Fraud Detection: How to Detect & Prevent It
Wondering about payment fraud detection? In this article, we’ll explain how payment fraud detection works and explore ways you can implement detection systems in your business.
What Is Payment Fraud Detection?
Payment fraud detection is the process of identifying attempts to make fraudulent transactions and preventing them from occurring. Forms of payment fraud can include the following and more:
- Card-Not-Present (CNP) Fraud
- Chargeback Fraud
- Account Takeover (ATO)
- Account Enrollment Fraud
Over the past few years, more businesses have shifted to eCommerce in the wake of COVID-19 to remain competitive and accessible to customers.
After swelling to $4.2 trillion in 2020, research from Outseer and Aite-Novarica Group estimates that total digital channel payments could hit $5.9 trillion by 2023. And that figure may grow if consumer enthusiasm for card-not-present (CNP)-enabled online and mobile purchases and popular payment options like Scan-and-Go, “invisible” payments, and Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) continue to intensify.
As it stands now, nearly 60% of consumers will choose a business with these or other forms of payment over a competitor that lacks them.
Unfortunately, fraudsters have taken full advantage of this shift. As digital channel sales have reached new heights over the past 18 months, so has payment fraud. Within the next two years, CNP fraud alone could lead to $17.2 billion in lost revenue annually. Throw in as much as $25.3 billion in loss due to chargeback fraud, and the financial damage starts to add up fast.
These attacks can quickly chip away at profits for merchants, credit card companies, and other payment processors.Payment fraud detection aims to identify fraudulent activities before transactions are made, without slowing down legitimate customer payments.
What Types of Attacks Does Payment Fraud Detection Prevent?
To better understand payment fraud detection, let’s look at a few examples of payment fraud attacks and how payment fraud detection can stop them.
Card-Not-Present (CNP) Fraud
Card-not-present fraud is committed when fraudsters use stolen credit card details without physical possession of the card. CNP fraud is among the most common forms of payment fraud as there are numerous techniques fraudsters can use to steal card details.
Cybercriminals often rely on phishing schemes to trick victims into entering their card details into a cloned version of a branded website. Fraudsters then make fraudulent purchases with this stolen information.
Data breaches are another common source for stolen card details. Even when a cardholder protects their information, attackers can steal their payment details from unsecured websites where their card was used. Fraudsters purchase such compromised credentials in bulk from dark web marketplaces and then use automated bots to test card details on vulnerable websites.
In both examples, the victim’s CVV is compromised, meaning CVV checks alone are not enough.
Payment fraud detection that employs the EMV® 3-D Secure protocol have proven to be remarkably effective and detecting and preventing payment fraud.
Today’s most robust 3DS-based solutions, for instance, analyze more than 100 different risk indicators to silently authenticate customers before a transaction even occurs. This enables merchants, issuers, and banks to deliver a fast, friendly checkout experience to legitimate customers while blocking fraudsters at the door.
Chargeback Fraud
Chargeback fraud occurs when a customer initiates a chargeback through their bank for a product they already received. When this happens by accident, it is referred to as “friendly fraud.” Sometimes customers can forget they made a purchase or forgot autopay was enabled.
No matter the intent, both scenarios result in a chargeback that refunds the customer and issues the business a chargeback fee. When fraudsters identify a vulnerable business, they can repeatedly target that company causing a wave of chargebacks.
Chargeback fees can range anywhere from $20 to $100, depending on the merchant’s agreement with their payment provider. Between acquisition costs, marketing, and transaction fees, chargebacks can leave businesses in the red on each transaction.
In one recent survey, 44% of merchants report experiencing return abuse of some kind in the last 12 months, and 66% say it’s getting worse. But preventing this form of payment fraud before it happens can be tricky.
Proven fraud detection methods can prevent chargeback fraud before the transaction is completed thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. By analyzing the behavior of the transaction history of the customer, merchants can filter out risky transactions that match the behavior of chargeback fraud.
Account Takeover
In account takeover (ATO) attacks, criminals use compromised login credentials to log into legitimate customer accounts and commit payment fraud using payment details on file or stolen credit card numbers. ATOs fueled by data breaches increased 850% between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021. As much as $16.9 billion is lost to this crime each year.
Cybercriminal organizations purchase entire databases of compromised login credentials and then use software to test and validate passwords that haven’t been changed. And in addition to email- and text-based phishing scams, the use of fraudulent branded apps designed to fool victims into revealing login credentials increased 49% just within the third quarter of 2021.
ATOs can be notoriously difficult to detect because transactions are coming from a legitimate cardholder or customer account. But it is possible. Bot detection solutions can recognize and block credentials stuffing attacks designed to infiltrate accounts. And modern fraud prevention solutions use data science and machine learning to distinguish normal account behavior from fraudulent activity—no matter who is signed into the account.

Payment Authentication | A Complete Explanation
Curious about payment authentication? We explain what it is, why it’s important, the methods you can use, and the right tools to do it with.
What Is Payment Authentication?
Payment authentication is the process of confirming a cardholder’s card number or other personal data isn’t being used to make payments without their knowledge. Banks and card issuers, merchants, and payment processors typically use a combination of authentication factors, including any mix of the following:
● Something a person knows, e.g., login information or secret question answers
● Something a person has, e.g., a mobile phone or computer
● Something a person is, e.g., using biometric technology such as fingerprint scanning
The Need for Payment Authentication
When it comes to online and mobile commerce, the need for transaction authentication has never been greater. Global spending on e-commerce reached $4.2 trillion in 2020, a growth of almost 28%. But losses from illegal purchases using stolen credit card numbers are growing nearly as fast.
Banks and card issuers, merchants and payment processors use forms of authentication to protect themselves from fraudulent transactions and chargebacks.
If you’ve ever shopped on the web or through mobile apps, for instance, you’ve likely encountered some form of payment authentication. One-time passcodes, challenge questions, fingerprint biometrics are a few common methods used to confirm your identity and confirm that payments made from your credit card or other accounts are legitimate.
But behind the scenes, card issuers, merchants and financial institutions have a series of authentication protocols beyond simple security questions. Let’s explore a few different authentication methods and how they work.
Card Verification Value (CVV)
The Card Verification Value (CVV) has become a standard method of authentication for ecommerce transactions. Today, most card-not-present (CNP) transactions made using a credit card number require the customer to enter the CVV, a 3- to 4-digit code listed on the front or back of the physical card, by default.
Pros:
● Prevents online transactions without the correct CVV Code
Cons:
● Only works when combined with other authentication methods
● Fraudulent purchases are still possible if someone has possession of a credit card, or acquires card details that include the CVV code
How Payment Authentication Works
Payment authentication relies on a series of systems and tools that communicate with customers, merchants, payment processors, card issuers and banks to validate transactions. Different techniques can work independently or together for more accurate authentication. Let’s review a few of the most popular authentication systems.
Address Verification System (AVS)
An Address Verification System (AVS) works to prevent credit card and bank fraud by comparing the billing address on the card with the one provided by the payee. When the customer provides their billing address, that address is scanned to see how accurate it is to the address that is on file at the credit card company.
The card issuer can give a full, partial, or no AVS match. Authentication relies on how closely the address matches. Depending on the AVS match, sellers can approve, cancel, or manually investigate the customer transaction.
AVS works well alongside other authentication methods but falls short on its own. Fraudsters can bypass AVS by using social media and other tools to identify the card owner’s address prior to the transaction.
Pros
● AVS is easy to implement
● AVS’s authentication is fast and doesn’t impact the user session
Cons
● AVS can be bypassed by criminals with partial knowledge of the address
● AVS alone isn’t enough to provide accurate authentication
Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)
CHAP checks a user’s identity during authentication by presenting the user a challenging question. As the challenge questions are sent, the CHAP server already has an expected response in mind. If the user answers that question correctly, CHAP authentication su-cceeds.
This methodology is used to authenticate sessions before login, meaning that this system doesn’t use shared secrets to validate an identity. This is particularly useful in preventing replay attacks, where an attacker reuses stolen credentials.
CHAP is often combined with Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and used before the customer enters their password. A CHAP challenge request could be a series of security questions, or even a small puzzle, the user must complete.
Like AVS, CHAP isn’t foolproof, but offers excellent protection from replay attacks and works well alongside other authentication methods.
Pros
● CHAP stops replay attacks before PAP
● CHAP doesn’t share secrets, meaning criminals cannot steal keys in transit
Cons
● Criminals can guess CHAP challenge questions through social engineering
● CHAP alone isn’t enough to provide accurate payment authentication for the user
3-D Secure 2 (3DS2)
EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS) is a global standard for authenticating CNP and digital transactions that allows merchants and payment providers to send contextual and payment information to institutions to assess the risk of a transaction. Information such as billing address, transaction history, device ID, purchase amount, and geolocation are considered when verifying a customer’s identity. Depending on the level of risk, the cardholder’s bank can issue a series of responses to help authenticate the payment.
If there is enough data to authenticate the user, the transaction succeeds through a frictionless flow. No other data is needed from the customer. If the bank believes the transaction is suspicious, the customer is sent through a challenge flow.
The challenge flow requires a user to verify identity via email, text message, or phone call. If the challenge is completed, the transaction may proceed. This methodology is known as risk-based authentication, where transactions are handled differently depending on their level of risk.
Pros
● Features frictionless flows that decrease cart abandonment and reduce checkout time
● Uses multiple data points to verify an identity
● Leverages machine learning to identity fraud
● Is consistent with best practices for verifying transactions
Cons
● The old version of 3-D Secure (3-DS1.x) was slow and did not support payments made through smart watches, gaming consoles and other IoT devices—issues that have been fixed in 3-DS2
Payment Authentication vs. Authorization
In short, payment authentication validates who a user is, whereas payment authorization gives the user access to a specific resource or functionality. You can think of authentication as having a key to the front door and specific authorizations allowing access to particular rooms inside.
Examples of payment authentication include the following:
● One-time pins – Codes sent via text, email, or phone call
● Authentication apps – Generates a unique security code that changes every few minutes
● Biometrics – Verifies identity through fingerprint, retinal scan, or facial recognition
Traits of payment authorization include the following:
● Grants data through access tokens
● Has policies that are managed by a security team
● Grants or denies access to resources
● Is not seen or changed by the customer
Both payment authentication and authorization work together to verify users and secure transactions. For example, a merchant may use 3-D Secure to prevent fraud and chargebacks while the bank runs an authorization check on the payer’s card to ensure they have enough credit to cover that transaction.
Payment Authentication Best Practices
Authentication must be both accurate and seamless to prevent chargebacks without impacting the customer experience. Here’s how you can implement fast and accurate authentication in your business.
Use Multiple Forms of Authentication
By layering different types of authentication, you decrease your chances of processing a fraudulent charge. While this used to be a more manual process, 3-D Secure accomplishes this by default and only applies additional challenges to suspicious transactions.
Leverage Big Data When Possible
The world is more connected now than ever before. Financial institutions and payment processors can use this data to provide real-time insights into the validity of transactions. Unlike static authentication, machine-learning algorithms are continuously improving to prevent fraud.

Payment Authentication: 3-D Secure Demystified
What the 3DS is going on? While the 3-D Secure protocol is de rigueur for fighting card-not-present fraud in the EU and elsewhere, penetration in North America has been stuck somewhere south of 2% for years. But today, that’s changing as more credit card companies and merchants recognize the sizable benefits the protocol brings to reducing both fraud and friction. For many, that starts with making sense of what has become a veritable Alphabet Soup of 3DS variants, including 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2.
To understand the need for 3DS, just consider the past year of unprecedented everything. In 2020, global ecommerce was supposed to grow a sumptuous 15% year-on-year. In the face of the pandemic, it rose 25% instead. And with so many consumers buying so much online, many for the first time, the focus has been on making the checkout process as hiccup-free as possible.
But it came with a price. In the US alone, losses from purchases made using stolen credit card information may have topped $6.4 billion in 2020, up from $5.5 billion in 2018. That’s an average growth rate of more than $40 million in losses per month for 24 months straight. And that may be low-balling it.
3-D Secure (3DS) was designed to change all that.
So What Exactly is 3-D Secure?
The 3DS payment authentication protocol was first introduced back in 1999, back in the days of the dial-up Internet. Its purpose: to prevent unauthorized use of a cardholder’s credit card in online purchases. To accomplish that, 3DS involves three parties, or “domains” (thus, the “3D” in 3DS)—the acquirer bank, the issuer bank, and the infrastructure supporting the protocol, whether it’s the Internet or software providers.
3DS1 was first deployed by Visa in the early 2000s, and while it was a step in the right direction, it came with notable issues. Among other things, it required credit card users to enroll in the system using static passwords that many would promptly forget. When making a purchase, 3DS assessed 15 rudimentary data elements to verify identity. And because 3DS shifted liability for fraudulent purchases to the card issuers, they often took a “better safe than sorry” approach that meant friction was all but guaranteed.
What’s more, a lot changed over the next 15 years—including the adoption of mobile as the go-to channel for Web browsing and making purchases. With 3DS 1.0, mobile users who couldn’t remember their passwords were redirected to a bank page that, more times than not, wasn’t optimized for mobile. SMS was used as an alternative, which presented problems of its own—especially if the customer was traveling abroad. Conversion rates dropped precipitously. It’s no wonder the US market has been less than enthusiastic about the protocol.
The Rise of 3DS2
3DS2 was introduced in 2016 to address the shortcomings of 3DS1 and is designed from the ground up to help secure payments while offering an improved user experience during the checkout process. 3DS2 is a major step forward because it:
- Supports mobile phones and other consumer-connected devices
- When making a purchase, data is sent first to the issuing bank to see if it needs additional verification
- Only risky transactions require challenges; otherwise, a “frictionless flow” process is initiated
This represents a significant paradigm shift, since it enables merchants to integrate the authentication process into their checkout experiences. Issuing banks can authorize payments using risk-based authentication, with no additional steps required by consumers.
Enter: 3DS-2.1 and -2.2
First introduced in 2019, 3DS 2.1 increases the number of data elements merchants send to issuers at the point of transaction to 100, with 20 required and the rest optional but recommended by EMVCo, the consortium behind the standards. With a richer dataset (including IP addresses, shipping address, device information, email, merchant risk factors, and more), issuers can make better-informed decisions, faster—enabling far more transactions to be handled with a frictionless flow process.
3DS 2.2 covers the same authentication and merchant fraud liability protection bases as 2.1, but adds the ability through their acquirer, as well. It also enables authentication through delegates, such as an acquirer or a. digital wallet provider.
Because of its use of two-factor authentication (including biometrics and token-based models, instead of relying on static passwords) 3DS2 has become a cornerstone of the secure customer authentication (SCA) rules in the EU’s second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which went into effect on December 31, 2020. As part of that version, merchants hitting certain low fraud thresholds can request exemption from SCA requirements from the issuer, providing for even faster transactions.
Catching on in North America
There are a number of reasons 3DS2 is gaining currency in the US and Canada.
- In a global economy, merchants and issuers doing business in the EU’s $300 billion ecommerce market are exempt from PSD2’s SCA requirements—but that could change
- The EU’s regulatory fervor is spreading; Mexico, Australia and others have started to adopt SCA regimes
- It may be just a matter of time before state or even federal regulations requiring such standards are enacted (looking at you, California)
It’s also just smart business. According to Visa Research, up to 72% of online shoppers have abandoned a shopping card over security concerns. They’re more than happy to jump to competitors that can deliver a fast, secure transaction. 3DS2 has been shown to reduce checkout ties by 85% and cart abandonment by 70%.
The good news: North American issuers, merchants and others don’t have to relive the past or present struggles faced by their EU counterparts. That’s because solutions like Outseer 3-D Secure are fully-hosted, requiring no additional IT staffing or overhead.
Through the use of modern machine learning and the world’s largest global network of shared fraud intelligence, less than 5% of all transactions require intervention with our solution. Which means the vast majority of customers will enjoy the secure, friction-free experience they demand.
I don’t know about you, but considering the risks and rewards, 3-D Secure 2.x is sounding pretty darn good to me.

PCI Compliance: Simply Defined | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/pci-compliance,2022-03-07,"PCI Compliance: Simply Defined
Wondering about PCI Compliance? We explain what it is, why it matters, and why you must adhere to it.
What Is PCI Compliance?
PCI compliance is a requirement to meet a set of technical and operational standards for protecting credit card data. PCI Compliance Standards are set by the PCI Security Standards Council.
The goal of PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliance is to protect customer financial information as technology evolves. The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of standards requiring all companies that process, store, or transmit credit card information to maintain a secure environment.
PCI standards are updated and managed by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC). The council is led by an executive committee with representatives from major credit card companies, such as Visa, American Express, and Discover. Outseer closely monitors developments in the compliance space and actively participates on the PCI SSC Board of Advisors.
Meeting and Maintaining Compliance
PCI DSS applies to any organization that accepts, transmits, or stores credit card information. Companies must comply with these standards regardless of how many transactions they process. PCI compliance is not a one-time assessment, either. It is an ongoing process that requires regular evaluations of the systems and practices organizations have in place to keep cardholder data safe.
PCI Compliance Penalties
The passing grade for PCI compliance is 100%, meaning one missed criterion puts a business in noncompliance. If a breach were to occur, and the lending bank or credit card company found your organization was in noncompliance at the time, you could be subject to hefty fines.
These fines can range from $5,000 to $500,000 depending on the size of your business and degree of noncompliance. You could also lose your ability to accept credit card payments for several years. And organizations that are monitored by the FTC may be subject to an FTC audit.
Lastly, customers who suffered a loss due to your non-compliance may file lawsuits against you. Not only are these time-consuming and expensive, but they also obliterate your brand image, costing you future business.
PCI Compliance Levels
The type of requirements your business must follow is determined by the number of transactions processed annually. This means small businesses will approach PCI compliance differently than an enterprise organization.
There are four merchant levels described by the PCI SSC:
Level 1: Merchants that process over six million card transactions annually.
Level 2: Merchants that process one to six million transactions annually.
Level 3: Merchants that process 20 thousand to one million transactions annually.
Level 4: Merchants that process fewer than 20 thousand transactions annually.
To ensure that payment information is protected, each level must undergo an assessment. Level 1 merchants must conduct an external audit conducted by an ISA (Internal Security Assessor) or QSA (Qualified Security Assessor).
Merchants between levels 2 and 4 can complete a self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ). It’s important to take your time when completing the self-assessment and answer truthfully, as dishonest answers can result in severe penalties if a breach occurs.
Compliance Requirements
There are both technical and procedural requirements set forth by the PCI SSC to meet PCI compliance.
Below are 12 of the key requirements to meet compliance:
- Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data
- Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters
- Protect stored cardholder data
- Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks
- Use and regularly update antivirus software or programs
- Develop and maintain secure systems and applications
- Restrict access to cardholder data on a need-to-know basis
- Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access
- Restrict physical access to cardholder data
- Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data
- Regularly test security systems and processes
- Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel
Depending on your organization’s size and structure, meeting compliance can take time. Having robust internal IT policies along with a systems administrator who manages the network can help keep your company compliant.
There are numerous auditing tools that can scan your network to identify and prioritize issues keeping you non-compliant. Administrators may need multiple tools to properly audit network configuration, access rights, and sensitive information storage.

Protecting Against Card-Not-Present Fraud
Organizations can fall in and out of PCI compliance, which can potentially leave credit information exposed. If stolen, this information can be used to make unauthorized purchases.
Even if your business is PCI compliant, credit card information stolen elsewhere can be used to make unauthorized card-not-present (CNP) transactions.
In the case of CNP fraud, business owners can end up footing the bill for each transaction. This not only results in a loss of revenue but can end with payment processors terminating their accounts with your business. According to the Aite-Novarica Group, loss from CNP fraud is expected to top $17.2 billion by 2023.
There are a few steps you can take to protect yourself from fraudulent charges:
- Implement EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS) payment authentication protocol
- Keep websites and online tools updated
- Require billing address (AVS) and CVV verification
- Leverage firewall rules to limit exposure to risky transactions

Protecting Against Card-Not-Present Fraud
Organizations can fall in and out of PCI compliance, which can potentially leave credit information exposed. If stolen, this information can be used to make unauthorized purchases.
Even if your business is PCI compliant, credit card information stolen elsewhere can be used to make unauthorized card-not-present (CNP) transactions.
In the case of CNP fraud, business owners can end up footing the bill for each transaction. This not only results in a loss of revenue but can end with payment processors terminating their accounts with your business. According to the Aite-Novarica Group, loss from CNP fraud is expected to top $17.2 billion by 2023.
There are a few steps you can take to protect yourself from fraudulent charges:
- Implement EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS) payment authentication protocol
- Keep websites and online tools updated
- Require billing address (AVS) and CVV verification
- Leverage firewall rules to limit exposure to risky transactions

PCI Compliance Checklist: What Are the 12 Requirements? | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/pci-compliance-checklist,2022-05-16,"PCI Compliance Checklist: What Are the 12 Requirements?
Looking into the PCI compliance checklist? We explain what the 12 requirements of PCI compliance are and how to ensure that you are compliant.
What Is on the PCI Compliance Checklist?
The 12 requirements of PCI compliance are as follows:
- Install and maintain a firewall.
- Do not use default passwords or settings.
- Protect stored cardholder data.
- Encrypt transmission of cardholder data.
- Protect against malware with antivirus software.
- Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.
- Restrict access to cardholder data.
- Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access.
- Restrict physical access to cardholder data.
- Monitor all access to network resources.
- Regularly test security systems and processes.
- Maintain a policy that addresses information security.
Why PCI Compliance Matters
PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliance is a set of evolving standards that aims to protect customer information and is a requirement for any organization that processes, stores, or transmits cardholder data.
PCI standards are developed and maintained by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is made up of stakeholders and affiliate members like Amazon, Google, and Square. Outseer closely monitors developments in the compliance space and actively participates on the PCI SSC Board of Advisors.
PCI compliance is not a one-time assessment, either. It is an ongoing process that requires regular evaluations of the systems and procedures organizations have in place to keep cardholder data safe.
The PCI Security Standards Council recently released version 4.0 of its Data Security Standard (DSS), which outlines a set of comprehensive standards for organizations to follow. Among other things, PCI DSS 4.0 is designed to add flexibility for different methodologies and enhance validation methods.
What Are the PCI Compliance Penalties?
The passing grade for PCI compliance is 100%, meaning one missed criterion puts a business in noncompliance, which can result in steep fines and consequences such as the following:
Failure to meet PCI compliance can result in steep fines and consequences that include:
- Fines varying from $5,000 to $100,000 per month
- Increased transaction fees
- Suspension of the non-compliant merchant account
- Increased auditing requirements
- Damage to brand reputation
- $50 to $90 per cardholder whose information is compromised
- Legal costs from lawsuits, settlements, and judgments
This can all add up fast. Today, a data breach of any kind costs US-based companies $9.05 million on average, per incident. And it can go much higher. At $90 per cardholder, for instance, the Capital One breach that exposed personal and payment information of 106 million customers could cost the bank up to $1 billion in cardholder compensation alone.
Who Enforces PCI Compliance?
PCI compliance is enforced by Visa, AmEx, Mastercard, Discover, and JCB International, but ultimately it is up to the organization handling cardholder data to meet PCI standards themselves. With that said, let’s explore exactly what you’ll need to do to meet PCI compliance.
PCI Compliance Checklist
PCI compliance doesn’t have to be complicated. Below we’ve taken each of the 12 PCI requirements and broken them down into simple actionable steps you can take to protect your customers and your business.
Install and Maintain a Firewall
A firewall secures your network traffic from the outside world and acts as a bridge between your internal network and the internet. Without a properly configured firewall, attackers can enter your network and access sensitive information like cardholder data.
Firewall solutions will range depending on your size and networking requirements. Many firewall vendors have a range of models that cater to small businesses and enterprises alike. Firewalls are useless without proper configuration, which means they should be maintained by a system administrator.
- Understand what firewall policies you’ll need to meet PCI compliance.
- Purchase a firewall for each location that handles cardholder data.
- Create a unique username and password for admin access.
- Configure each firewall and validate its settings.
- Regularly patch and maintain the firewall to keep it secure.
Change Default Passwords
Both hardware and software often come with default passwords upon setup. While these default passwords seem convenient, they leave your organization vulnerable to attack. Cybercriminals can crawl the internet and identify different internet-facing applications. With a bit of scripting, attackers can test the default credentials of thousands of devices and systems.
Accounting software, Wi-Fi routers, network switches, and web applications can all be vulnerable to default password attacks.
- Create a list of your hardware and software solutions.
- Audit your hardware and software for default credentials.
- Verify each user account is using a strong nondefault password.
- Maintain documentation of changes.
Protect Stored Cardholder Data
Organizations that store, transmit, or process cardholder data in digital or physical form must take appropriate steps to protect that data. Depending on your business, these steps will vary. For example, stored cardholder data must be secured with strong encryption and truncated when viewed.
- Only retain cardholder data if authorized and necessary for business.
- Identify exactly where payment data is stored.
- Use strong and modern encryption techniques to render data unreadable.
- Use tokenization to further protect stored data.
- Restrict access to cardholder data by limiting access to encryption keys and account logins.
- Truncate or mask the primary account number when the full PAN is not needed.
- Never store cardholder PINs, card validation codes, or the full contents of a magnetic stripe or chip.
Encrypt Transmission of Cardholder Data
Similar to data storage, sensitive cardholder data in transit also must be secured. If left unsecured, plaintext information can be stolen through a variety of attacks.
A common technique attackers use is called packet sniffing, where a small piece of software listens across a network and copies traffic related to credit card payments. If this traffic is left unencrypted, attackers can easily see the contents of these packets and abuse cardholder data.
- Secure data over open or public networks such as the internet, cellular data, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPRS, and Satcom.
- Encrypt data with strong cryptography protocols such as SSL, TLS, SSH, and IPSEC.
- Ensure protocols in use only support secure versions and configurations.
- Disable weak versions of protocols such as SSL v2.0, WEP, and TLS 1.0.
- Only use trusted keys and certificates.
Protect Against Malware
If left unsecured, your network can be vulnerable to malware that silently collects cardholder data and sends its back to the attackers who deployed it. Malware can enter your network through a variety of channels such as email, vulnerable applications, account takeover, USB drives, and malicious links.
To combat this, organizations often take a layered approach to security that includes a firewall, endpoint security, intrusion detection, and vulnerability remediation. At the very minimum organizations should use business anti-malware software that monitors the network and endpoints for threats in conjunction with their firewall.
- Use an email gateway to identify and block phishing scams and malicious links.
- Install business-grade antivirus software on company computers and phones.
- Use intrusion detection systems that monitor the network for malicious behavior.
- Centralize your monitor efforts through 24/7 threat management.
Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Applications
PCI compliance is an ongoing process that involves conducting self-audits, performing routine security tasks, and designing new procedures. A large part of staying compliant is creating policies and procedures that align with the PCI standard.
Typically, organizations conduct a risk assessment and take note of all the software and hardware that involves cardholder data. Once listed, managers can assign proper access controls, audits, and procedures for staff to follow.
This same process applies to software development, patching, and vulnerability remediation. Organizations use vulnerability scanning tools and remediation teams to ensure systems are patched and PCI compliant.
- Implement a vulnerability disclosure and remediation program.
- Conduct routine self-assessments and compliance audit across your systems.
- Designed policies and procedures for staff that align with PCI compliance requirements.
- Install patches and hotfixes regularly and keep systems up to date.
Restrict Access to Cardholder Data
Cardholder data should only be accessible to those who absolutely need it. Each user should have their own username and password and never log in with a shared or generic account. This is necessary for accurate auditing during a data breach or internal investigation.
This rule extends to physical information as well. PCI compliance rules state that organizations should use appropriate access controls to monitor and limit physical access to cardholder data. This includes keeping records locked and secure, having staff present where PCI information is stored, and using security measures to monitor access.
These steps prevent cardholder information from being stolen, as well as destroyed by unauthorized persons.
- Only grant access to cardholder information to individuals that need it.
- Ensure each account has a unique username and password.
- Never use a shared or generic account.
- Leverage fraud prevention technology to stop account takeover attacks.
- Implement two-factor authentication when possible.
- Conduct physical audits of locks, card readers, and security systems.
Monitor Access to All Network Resources
Networks provide a path to access cardholder data, even when those systems appear segmented. Crafty attackers use various methods to gain access to network resources and computers in order to steal data, impersonate staff, and hijack funds.
A common strategy is for attackers to send phishing messages to staff that have privileged access to cardholder data. These messages are designed to trick the victim into clicking a malicious link or entering their login credentials to a fake site. Criminals use these attacks to plant additional malware, access sensitive systems, and work their way deeper into more secure areas of a network.
- Use risk-based account monitoring to prevent unauthorized access.
- Use a SIEM-based tool to monitor and record network activity.
- Keep an audit of time-stamped network activity for at least one year.
- Assign a staff member to review networking monitoring efforts and system reliability.
Regularly Test Security Systems and Processes
Scheduled testing is crucial to maintaining PCI compliance. Criminals are constantly looking for new loopholes, unpatched systems, and uninformed staff to exploit. Regular testing ensures the systems you put in place are working as expected and cover new devices or applications.
Vulnerability and penetration testing as well as PCI compliance scans can help you stay compliant and prioritize the issues you need to resolve first. External-facing domains and IP addresses must be scanned by a PCI Approved Scanning Vendor.
This scan might determine you need a static IP address or you need to update your TLS to meet compliance. Your system administrator can help you meet these requirements. Internal vulnerability and compliance scans should also be performed quarterly.
- Perform quarterly vulnerability and PCI compliance scans.
- Detect rogue access points by scanning for networks in your areas quarterly.
- Implement penetration testing standards (NIST SP800-115, 800-53, etc.).
- Deploy change detection for security configurations.
- Document how tests should be performed and what to do if there are compliance issues.
Maintain a Policy That Addresses Information Security
PCI compliance should be a company-wide effort with each department and team understanding their roles and responsibilities to meet compliance. this security policy should educate all staff, management, and third parties on how your systems should be handled.
Typically anyone with access to these systems should read and sign access requirements, undergo a background check, and participate in PCI compliance awareness training. These steps greatly reduce the risk that cardholder data will be abused or mishandled internally.
- Create a company information security policy with a PCI compliance partner.
- Require staff to acknowledge and sign the policy.
- Run background checks on staff before allowing access to the company network.
- Conduct annual staff training regarding the policy.
- Review the policy annually to include any new systems or procedures.

Phishing Protection: Best Ways to Defend Your Organization | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/phishing-protection,2022-04-13,"Phishing Protection: Best Ways to Defend Your Organization
Looking into phishing protection? In this blog, we explain what phishing protection is, how it works, and best practices to protect your organization and customers.
What Is Phishing Protection?
Phishing is a sophisticated method fraudsters use to trick victims into revealing confidential information. Phishing protection refers to the measures companies take to protect themselves and their customers against phishing scams—including a combination of education, AI-based detection, and takedown services.
What Is Phishing?
Phishing is the practice of using email, SMS text messages, cloud-based collaboration platforms, and other methods to impersonate trusted companies or individuals in order to fool recipients into revealing login credentials, banking information, or payment details. These attacks employ well-crafted messages, stolen brand images, and cloned websites to appear as much like the real deal as possible.
The information pilfered from victims is typically used to commit numerous types of fraud or is collected and sold on dark web marketplaces. With stolen payment details, cyberthieves can make illegal purchases on e-commerce sites.
With stolen email login credentials, fraudsters can infiltrate personal or corporate email accounts and gather intel for impersonating the account owner in attacks targeting colleagues and others. When they lead to a data breach, the average cost to U.S.-based companies is $9.05 million per incident. Total average costs from phishing-related attacks on business may be as high as $14 million per year.
If the compromised logins are for consumer bank accounts, they are free to drain funds—including personal life savings. As reported in our latest quarterly Fraud & Payments Report, fraudulent transactions made through compromised accounts accounted for 76.5% of all fraud loss in the banking sector during the fourth quarter of 2021—up nearly 20% from the second quarter of the year.
According to Javelin Strategy & Research, the price tag for all forms of phishing-related fraud losses may now be as high as $43 billion per year.
Despite innocence, companies that get impersonated in these phishing scams can pay a steep price as well. Lost business and lawsuits can cause significant financial and reputational harm. And the negative publicity could cause consumer or business recipients to ignore your legitimate, revenue-generated email programs at a time when digital channels are more important than ever. According to Forrester, lost customer trust or even just suspicion can reduce revenues up to 25% for a full year.
Types of Phishing Attacks
But not all phishing scams are created equal. Basic phishing messages are sent to large volumes of recipients, with no particular target in mind. Fraudsters understand that basic phishing is a numbers game, so they focus on quantity over quality. These attacks can target a company’s employees, customers, or the general public.
Spear phishing, on the other hand, takes the opposite approach by using highly-customized messages, domains, and other tactics that target or impersonate a particular individual. In most cases, this is a well-placed, high-value corporate employee. For example, a spear-phishing attack could impersonate a C-suite executive requesting direct employee deposit details from the CFO, or a member of the finance staff.
Before we dive into phishing protection strategies, let’s touch on how you can spot phishing messages in the first place.
Spotting Phishing Messages
Even with phishing protections in place, it’s important to know how to identify phishing messages if they slip through the cracks. Phishing messages are most commonly sent via email, but they can also be found in text messages through mobile phishing and across social media.
Below are some tactics you can use to spot phishing messages before you fall victim to one.
Be Skeptical of Urgency
Fraudsters rely on urgency to trick victims into taking action quickly before thinking to confirm the legitimacy of the message. This can include a past-due notice, a fraud alert, or a password-reset warning requiring immediate attention. When targeting businesses, these emails are often delivered late in the day to amplify anxiety over failing to deliver for a senior executive. If a message seems urgent and requires immediate action, recipients should pause and scrutinize the message for indications of fraud before clicking any links, opening attachments, or taking any action.
Verify the Sending Domain
If a message states it’s coming from Microsoft, verify that the sender’s email address ends in @microsoft.com. Clever phishing attacks will employ “domain spoofing,” which involves buying domain names that are close, but not exact matches to legitimate domain in an attempt to fool recipients into trusting the message.
For example, johndoe@acme.com could be spoofed as johndoe@acrne.com. Recipients that message this address regularly might not catch that fraudsters switched the last three letters in the domain.
Another, more common approach is display name impersonation. This involves changing the display names on free email accounts such as Gmail or Yahoo in order to deceive recipients. Recipients would have to click on the From field to see that the sender is not the same as the display name—an especially big problem with some mobile email clients that only show the display name.
Recipients who aren’t confident about the legitimacy of an email messages should avoid clicking on links, opening attachments, or acting on requests within the message.
Watch for Misspellings and Bad Grammar
Many phishing attacks stem from non-English speaking countries. These fraudsters rely on translation services, which leave behind misspellings, inconsistencies, and bad grammar. While bad grammar alone isn’t a cause for alarm, it should serve as a red flag for identifying potential phishing messages.
Examine Links Before Clicking
You can hover your cursor over a link to preview where it will take you. This is useful for identifying phishing messages that impersonate certain services. For example, a fake Microsoft Teams phishing email might state the link will take you to reset your password. If that link goes anywhere other than the real Microsoft domain, you know it’s a phishing attempt.
Below is an example of previewing a customer service hyperlink in an email. We can see from the preview that the link redirects to the company domain as it should.
This method isn’t foolproof. Fraudsters can use a series of redirects and spoofed domains to appear legitimate or confuse the victim. System administrators should implement phishing protection that prevents phishing links from reaching their user’s mailboxes.
Be Wary of Attachments
Malicious attachments allow attackers to hide malware and execute code on the target machine. This can unleash spyware in the background that steals sensitive information, or ransomware that holds your files hostage until you pay the perpetrators.
Even innocent-looking Word file attachments can hold links that direct victims to a phishing page. This is a common tactic to bypass anti-phishing scans. It’s important to only click on attachments from senders you trust, and avoid attachments with suspicious file extensions (.exe, .scr, .vbs, etc.).
In business environments, administrators should implement email policies that automatically block these files types and remain vigilant for new rogue attachment trends.
Phishing Protection Strategies
Below are a few of the best phishing protection strategies organizations can use to protect employees, customers, suppliers, and other consumers and businesses.
Implement Multi-Factor Authentication
Multi-factor authentication helps prevent unauthorized users from accessing the account by requiring an additional form of authentication during login. This is typically a one-time code sent via text message or generated by an authenticator app.
MFA is one of the best forms of phishing protection you can implement because even if someone falls victim to a phishing scam, the attacker cannot access that account. Organizations often use a combination of artificial intelligence and MFA to prevent phishing and mitigate the damage if credentials are stolen.
Configure Strong Email Policies
Administrators should implement robust email authentication measures to help protect users from phishing messages. A few of the best phishing protections to put in place include the following:
- Enable external email tags to warn recipients to verify the authenticity of email
- Configure email records for authentication protocols like SPF, DKIM, DMARC & BIMI
- Implement brand abuse monitoring to detect domain spoofing of your own domains
- Block or flag common phishing top-level domains (.xyz, .biz, etc.)
- Block or flag emails originating from countries known for large volumes of phishing email
- Block emails with attachments known to be malicious
- Deploy AI-based tools that establish baseline email behaviors to recognize attacks
Use Robust Password Policies
Administrators should enforce strong passwords that change on a periodic basis. This prevents passwords from being reused and disrupts any access from an account that has been compromised. Robust password policies can also help prevent account takeover through brute-force attacks.
Educate Your Staff
Phishing training helps staff identify fraudulent messages before they reach their inbox. All levels of staff must take part in phishing training as some attacks target high-ranking staff members specifically.
Phishing education often involves watching training videos but can also include sending a campaign of test phishing emails to the company. The phishing campaign sends faked messages to staff and records whether they open the link. This can help gauge your company’s level of phishing awareness and track improvements over time.
Prevent Brand Impersonation With a Cyberattack Takedown Service
Organizations seeking to avoid being impersonated in attacks targeting their own employees, customers, suppliers, and others are advised to employ cyberattack monitoring and takedown services.
Using our own offering as an example, Outseer FraudAction prevents imposters from exploiting your brand by continuously monitoring social media, app stores, and over a million URLs each day.
Through data science and our global partner network, the experts in our Anti-Fraud Command Center continuously scour the threat landscape for signs of brand abuse and the phishing sites used to support these scams. Once detected, we take immediate steps to shut down these sites and neutralize phishing attacks before they ever reach your employees or anyone else.

David Pedersen shares his experiences growing up and delving into the corporate world as a member of LGBTQIA+. He includes 5 tips to companies looking to better support their employees.
I’m one of the lucky ones. For many LGBTQIA+ kids facing discrimination, words of support typically fall squarely in “it gets better” territory. I never faced the challenges so many others faced growing up—which created challenges of its own when I hit adulthood. The lessons I’ve learned can be instructive to organizations seeking to show support for LGBTQIA+ employees and the community. It might just surprise you.
Growing Up, Coming Out
To explain what I mean, it might help to start by hitting rewind, back to 1998. I was a junior at College Preparatory School in Oakland, California—a small but very inclusive academic environment. I remember a student getting detention for scratching a homophobic epithet on one of the school’s buildings. The faculty’s zero-tolerance policy against hateful language made me feel safe, supported, and included.
One day, I arrived home from school to find my mom bustling about the living room. She asked me how my day was, and, in typical teenage fashion, I gave her a terse, “It was fine” before beelining it for my bedroom. But before I left, I turned and said: “Oh by the way, I’m gay.” My mom’s response? An enormous hug that emanated the kind of love and acceptance all LGBTQIA+ community members should experience. Later that year, I took my first boyfriend to prom. I felt like any other normal kid because that’s how I was treated.
Coming out early was beneficial. Understanding my identity and being embraced by my loved ones gave me the space to foster a level of confidence and security that so many LGBTQIA+ folks find hard to attain.
Bubble: Burst
By 2008, I was starting my career in tech, which I continue to enjoy nearly 15 years later. But early on, I began to realize just what a safe bubble I’d been living in. It became clear to me that there are two common approaches some companies take in supporting LGBTQIA+ employees: refuse to participate in LGBTQIA+ causes at all, or engage in something approaching performative activism.
One year during the Gay Pride Parade in San Francisco, I remember feeling impressed by a popular tech company’s float stacked with excited employees waving rainbow flags and shouting phrases of acceptance. I read later that this company—used by millions of LGBTQIA+ creators worldwide—had instructed employees attending the festivities to refrain from talking about its actual (and quite noxious) LGBTQIA+ policies. In that moment, the safety of my protective bubble was gone.
5 Tips for True Support
This incident was pivotal for me. I needed to have my blinders ripped off in order to approach the world of work differently. It was imperative for me to spend my time and energy on organizations that are unabashedly supportive of LGBTQIA+ employees in effective and intentional ways. If ever a company has been in need of direction on this score, I’ve been happy to provide it—so long as its commitment to supporting employees is unwavering.
In fact, I’ve been asked by companies on several occasions: “How do we support our LGBTQIA+ employees in a meaningful way, and without directly soliciting information—or making assumptions—about their orientation?” Here are a few ideas to get you started:
• Launch an LGBTQIA+ support group. Be sure to make it open to all LGBTQIA+ identifying folks and non-LGBTQIA+ identifying allies.
• Add clear LGBTQIA+ inclusive language into company non-discrimination clauses and policies, and in as many internal and external facing materials you see fit: job postings, town hall decks, boilerplates, etc.
• Make a sizeable donation to a LGBTQIA+ support group or charity—but do so during any month other than June. Otherwise, it can come off as empty virtue signaling.
• Instead of being the main event, think of June as the start of Q1 for your LGBTQIA+ initiatives. Make it the month when the company’s executive team, including LGBTQIA+ support group members, reviews their approach to LGBTQIA+ inclusivity. Determine what’s working and what’s not working for LGBTQIA+ employees, and develop an agreed-upon action plan for the year ahead.
• Caveat emptor: Be sure to conduct due diligence on any charity before donating. A good place to start is Human Rights Campaign. Be wary of large, well-known charities that can seem relatively innocuous but may have a history of homophobia.
• Even if you only have a small budget, you can still show support with a very light lift. And demonstrating acceptance is always free.
Word to the wise: just like my own bubble, some people may not recognize the presence of homophobia in the workplace if they’re not negatively impacted by it. And even without blatant homophobia, your LGBTQIA+ colleagues can still feel unsafe and unsupported.
According to a 2021 survey from Glassdoor, 53% of LGBTQIA+ employees say they’ve experienced or witnessed anti-LGBTQIA+ comments by co-workers. And 47% say they believe being out at work could hurt their career. Instead of self-congratulations, these results suggest organizations that think they’re doing a good job can always find ways to do better.
Instead of just performative support this June, let’s all commit to getting better about the real kind.",,,0,2022-06-01,"Pride & Progress: Plenty to Celebrate, Work to Be Done | Outseer. Pride & Progress: Plenty to Celebrate, Work to Be Done

Protecting Against Escalating Financial Fraud in Japan: A Comprehensive Approach with Outseer | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/protecting-against-escalating-financial-fraud-in-japan,2023-09-25,"Protecting Against Escalating Financial Fraud in Japan: A Comprehensive Approach with Outseer
The surge in financial fraud through phishing scams in Japan is undeniable, with over 3 billion Yen stolen in more than 2300 incidents during the first half of 2023. As criminals constantly evolve their tactics, it’s crucial for both individuals and financial institutions to adopt robust protective measures.
Understanding the Impact of Scams
The consequences of these scams are profound. With substantial Yen losses and compromised financial records, victims face not only financial hardship but also emotional distress and compromised personal data. Additionally, these incidents erode consumer trust in financial institutions and online transactions, putting the integrity of the entire financial system at risk.
A Layered Approach to Combatting Financial Fraud
Effectively countering the rising threat of financial fraud and phishing scams demands a multi-faceted approach. This involves proactive measures to detect and prevent various forms of cyber threats, combined with the implementation of advanced solutions like Outseer Fraud Manager and 3-D Secure to ensure secure financial transactions and protect consumers.
Mitigating Scams
Phishing scams remain a leading avenue for financial fraud in Japan. Criminals exploit unsuspecting individuals by impersonating legitimate institutions and coaxing them into revealing sensitive information. Outseer’s solutions work in tandem to combat these and other prevalent fraud threats.
- Phishing Detection: Outseer’s Anti-fraud Command Center (AFCC) boasts enhanced detection capabilities. By analysing vast data feeds consisting of an average of 140 million URLs per month, it employs advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to rapidly identify and flag phishing URLs. This allows for swift investigation and action, resulting in a faster response time, heightened detection rates, and reduced instances of false positives in detecting fraud threats.
- 3-D Secure Fraud Prevention: Outseer’s 3-D Secure provides an additional layer of security for online transactions. Through two-factor authentication and customisable step-up challenges, it verifies user identities before authorising payments. This added verification step significantly diminishes the risk of unauthorised transactions, forming a strong defence against breaches originating from phishing attacks.
- Cross Channel Protection: Outseer’s Fraud Manager utilises advanced machine learning and data analytics to identify suspicious patterns and behaviours indicative of fraud. By analysing diverse data points, it proactively detects and prevents fraudulent activities. This proactive approach ensures timely identification and prevention of potential financial fraud.
A Unified Defence: A Holistic Approach
The arrest of an overseas suspect in connection with a Japanese phishing operation underscores the global nature of these cybercrimes. With cross-border collaboration becoming imperative, Outseer’s solutions offer a unified defence against these evolving threats.
As advised by the police, individuals should exercise caution when interacting with suspicious messages and only provide sensitive data on trusted platforms. Meanwhile, financial institutions must heed the recommendations of the Japanese Bankers Association and bolster their security infrastructure.
Incorporating proactive phishing attack detection with robust financial transaction protection through Outseer’s solutions creates a comprehensive and layered defence strategy. This not only safeguards consumers’ financial assets but also upholds the reputation of financial institutions, ultimately preserving trust in the digital financial landscape.

Scams in Australia have seen a concerning rise, with financial losses reaching over $3 billion in 2022 and an average loss of $19,654 per victim. The evolving tactics of scammers, including the use of advanced AI technologies like deepfakes and voice cloning, present a growing threat to individuals and organizations alike. In this blog, we’ll explore the latest scam statistics, and trends, and how Outseer’s proven products and services can help protect you from falling victim to these scams.
Scams in Australia: A Deepening Threat
Scams in Australia have reached alarming levels, with 2022 seeing a surge in financial losses, totaling over $3 billion. Despite a 16.5% decrease in reported cases compared to 2021, the staggering increase in financial losses underscores the growing sophistication of scammers.
Among the top scams by loss, investment scams took the lead, accounting for a massive $377 million, closely followed by dating and romance scams and false billing scams. Interestingly, people aged 65 and over reported the highest financial losses, constituting 26.4% of victims. Surprisingly, those aged 18–24 reported the lowest number of losses at just 3.4%.
As of September 2023, the scam landscape continues to evolve. There have been reports, to Scamwatch, of a substantial amount of $367 million lost to scams, with investment scams leading the financial losses at $221 million and phishing being the most reported scam.
AI and the Scam Landscape
The role of AI in scams has become increasingly prominent, with scammers harnessing its power to create convincing fraudulent content. Deepfakes for instance, involve scammers using AI to create lifelike audio and video impersonations, making distinguishing between genuine and fake content challenging. Similarly, ChatGPT and other generative AI tools are used to craft messages that mimic legitimate communication, making it harder to spot fraudulent emails and messages.
One recent example of a scam involves pre-recorded messages left in Mandarin via voicemail or on social media networks like WeChat and WhatsApp. Victims are told they have a parcel on hold and may face threats of transferring large sums of money, extortion, deportation, or arrest. This scam illustrates the dynamic nature of fraudulent activities.

Protecting Payments is Expanding the Identity Life Cycle | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/protecting-payments-is-expanding-the-identity-life-cycle,2025-08-13,"Protecting Payments is Expanding the Identity Life Cycle
The popularity of instant payments capabilities is growing around the world. Outseer has seen increases of 55% to 70% in mule activity, account takeover (ATO) activity, and authorized push payment (APP) fraud related to instant payments. (2024 Outseer Global Fraud & Scams Trends Report, pg. 20) Real-time payment fraud has been identified by fraud professionals as one of the top two fraud vectors in the US, Asia-Pacific, and Europe. (2025 Global eCommerce Payments & Fraud Report, p. 24, fig. 22) With the growth in scam losses and attention brought to scams, financial institutions, money service businesses, and telecommunications companies can expect to shoulder increased blame. (ACFE Fraud Magazine, Jan 2025)
And the fight is no longer about good guys and bad guys. There is a growing grey area. Visa has documented a staggering 244% increase in synthetic identities used in applications based on forged documents. (FinTech Magazine, May 2025)
Oh, no, this is not another blog post that regurgitates the depth of the fraud problem, is it?!
Well, yes and no. (Guilty as charged . . .) Above you’ve been provided with some helpful resources that should provide ample fodder for internal project justification. But the point here is to get us all in the same head space as we look to “force multipliers” in the fight against fraud.
Identity is a potential area to explore to find such a force multiplier in the fight against fraud. As Kay Turner with FinCEN says, “to get financial services right, we have to get identity right.” (Biometric Update, Feb 2024)
In order to turn identity into a force multiplier in the fight against fraud, perhaps we need some adjustments to the way we think about identities and their relationship to payments. There was a time that given a 3.5″ floppy drive and knowledge of an account number, you could login to access online services for that account. We have made significant progress on two fronts since then: 1) we have the ability to do much better binding of a digital credential to the proper human being; and 2) once we establish the digital credential, we have a much more robust toolbox of authenticators. Yes, we still have the challenge over “security vs. convenience,” but the tool box is well stocked.
So why are these fraud numbers continuing to grow? We have continued to play whack-a-mole with the fraudsters as we add hurdles to services (either onboarding or transactional).
I had a board member who used to say “you can fool anything anytime, but you can’t fool everything every time.” (RIP, Jim Woodhill) How can we take this premise and apply it to fraud fighting?
Think of the way we treat digital identity is a series of ladders. There is a ladder of activity we put a consumer through to get an account. Then there is another ladder we put them through to establish digital access. There might be another ladder we put them through to complete transactions (looking at you, 3DS2!). These ladders are placed in different locations, use different approaches, and likely do not share experience data.
So what if we shifted from thinking of the identity process as a series of ladders, to using the analogy of a conveyor belt. Better yet, an infinity torus! Identity is not something that we “establish,” then move on to the next step. We must be constantly challenging the assumptions we’ve made and share information across the identity life cycle.
But wait, what about customer experience, you say. Perhaps by treating identity as an something that needs ongoing grooming, we can actually create BETTER user experiences. One problem with the “ladders” is they are different processes using different terminology and different user interfaces. A continuous identity handling process presents an opportunity to unify experiences (and share experience information along the way). Another problem is the “point-in-time” nature of many identity management processes, the customer can be put through more rigorous challenges on occasion. And that occasion seems to always fall at an inconvenient time!
Perhaps the greatest benefit of a continuous identity life cycle is that we get a very complete view of who a user is by how they behave. As the advent of scams has made clear, financial institutions and payment service providers are being asked to “do something” to help protect customers. It turns out that the one thing we have a very hard time figuring out is the “intent” of a payment. If the right person with the right credentials wants to send money, our default is to send the money. Developing ways to understand the intent of a payment can give fraud fighters signals that will slow a customer down. In fact, many jurisdictions are passing rules to explicitly allow FIs to slow down payments when a scam is suspected. (AARP, Dec 2024)
How do you start on the road to continuous authentication? The first step is to break down the silos between teams responsible for AML/KYC, identity, authentication, and fraud. There is much common ground already, but continuous authentication requires a deeper level of cooperation. It is likely that these teams, when presented with the continuous conveyor belt theory of identity management, would be excited to participate!",,"account takeover, fraud, payment fraud, scam",4,2025-08-13,"Protecting Payments is Expanding the Identity Life Cycle | Outseer.

"PSD3: Changes, Impacts on Finance, and Future Implications | Outseer",https://www.outseer.com/blog/psd3-changes-impacts-on-finance-and-future-implications,2023-07-20,"PSD3: Changes, Impacts on Finance, and Future Implications
The European Commission has recently proposed new measures to bring the payments and financial sector in line with the digital age. The revised Payment Services Directive (PSD3) and the proposed Payment Services Regulation (PSR) aim to enhance consumer protection, promote competition, and enable secure data sharing for better financial products and services. This blog provides an overview of the key changes introduced by PSD3, and its profound influence on the finance industry, specifically in terms of bolstering payment security and fortifying fraud prevention measures. It is important to note that at the time of this blog, the transition deadline and technical details are currently unknown.
PSD3: Addressing Changing Market Dynamics
The payments landscape has undergone rapid transformation in reaction to the global pandemic. The value of electronic payments in the EU has been steadily increasing, reaching €240 trillion in 2021. Digital technologies have enabled innovative payment providers, including fintech firms, to respond to user demands for faster payments and P2P payment options on smartphones. However, this growth has also exposed consumers to new forms of fraud and risks.
Key Changes in PSD3
- Combating Payment Fraud: PSD3 enables payment service providers to share fraud-related information, enhances consumer awareness, strengthens customer authentication rules, extends refund rights for fraud victims, and mandates a system for verifying payees’ IBAN numbers.
- Improving Consumer Rights: The directive introduces measures to address temporary fund blockages, enhances transparency in account statements, and provides clearer information on ATM charges.
- Levelling the Playing Field: PSD3 aims to promote fair competition by granting non-bank payment service providers access to all EU payment systems while ensuring appropriate safeguards and securing their rights to a bank account.
- Enhancing Open Banking: The directive removes remaining barriers to open banking services, empowering customers to have more control over their payment data. This promotes innovation and enables the entry of new services into the market.
- Access to Cash: PSD3 facilitates the availability of cash by allowing retailers to provide cash services without requiring a purchase. Additionally, it clarifies rules for independent ATM operators.
Impact on the Finance Industry
PSD3 brings several positive implications for the finance industry:
- Enhanced Consumer Protection: The measures implemented under PSD3 aim to strengthen consumer rights, provide greater transparency, and improve security measures. Financial institutions will need to change to meet the new regulations and foster trust in electronic payments and financial services.
- Increased Competition: By leveling the playing field between banks and non-banks, PSD3 encourages competition and innovation. This allows for a wider range of payment service providers and facilitates the entry of new players into the market.
- Open Banking Advancements: PSD3 further promotes open banking by removing obstacles and enhancing customer control over their financial data. This paves the way for more personalised and innovative financial services.
- Streamlined Processes: The improvements in transparency, consumer rights, and data sharing facilitate smoother and cost-effective processes such as product comparisons, switching financial products, and mortgage applications.
- SME Access to Finance: PSD3 enables small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to access a broader range of financial services and products. Their creditworthiness data becomes more accessible, leading to more competitive loan options.
Embracing the Future: PSD3 Paving the Way for a Digital Financial Revolution
PSD3’s proposed amendments to the Payment Services Directive and the establishment of the Payment Services Regulation represent a significant stride towards adapting the financial sector to the ongoing digital transformation. These measures aim to enhance consumer protection, promote competition, streamline processes, improve access to finance for SMEs, and enable secure data sharing within the European payments and financial sector.
By prioritizing consumer security and trust, PSD3 supports the continuous growth of electronic payments within the EU. Moreover, the focus on open banking and data sharing is poised to fuel innovation and competition in the financial industry, ushering in a new era of financial services.
Although the specific transition deadline and technical details are still pending, there are proactive steps that can be taken at present:
- It is evident that consumers will have enhanced rights to expedited reimbursement in the event of fraud. By fortifying fraud prevention systems, the occurrence of fraudulent activities can be significantly reduced, thereby minimizing the need for future reimbursement.
- Customers will possess greater control over their payment data. To facilitate a smooth transition and seamless integration of payment risk solutions, it is crucial to streamline payment systems and ensure that legacy applications are prepared for the changes brought about by Open Banking.
- While the functional implementation of 3DS is mandated, it is expected that these consumer protection requirements will exert additional pressure to develop a 3DS solution that effectively thwarts fraud. Mere token integrations with minimal impact on fraud prevention will no longer suffice.
It is crucial for financial institutions and consumers to remain informed about the latest developments surrounding PSD3. Staying up to date will ensure preparedness for the forthcoming changes in the EU’s financial landscape and enable stakeholders to capitalize on the opportunities presented by this progressive directive.",,"fraud, payment fraud",2,2023-07-20,"PSD3: Changes, Impacts on Finance, and Future Implications | Outseer.

- It is evident that consumers will have enhanced rights to expedited reimbursement in the event of fraud. By fortifying fraud prevention systems, the occurrence of fraudulent activities can be significantly reduced, thereby minimizing the need for future reimbursement.
- Customers will possess greater control over their payment data. To facilitate a smooth transition and seamless integration of payment risk solutions, it is crucial to streamline payment systems and ensure that legacy applications are prepared for the changes brought about by Open Banking.
- While the functional implementation of 3DS is mandated, it is expected that these consumer protection requirements will exert additional pressure to develop a 3DS solution that effectively thwarts fraud. Mere token integrations with minimal impact on fraud prevention will no longer suffice.
It is crucial for financial institutions and consumers to remain informed about the latest developments surrounding PSD3. Staying up to date will ensure preparedness for the forthcoming changes in the EU’s financial landscape and enable stakeholders to capitalize on the opportunities presented by this progressive directive.","psd3: changes, impacts finance, future implications | outseer. psd3: changes, impacts finance, future implications european commission recently proposed new measures bring payments financial sector line digital age. revised payment services directive (psd3) proposed payment services regulation (psr) aim enhance consumer protection, promote competition, enable secure data sharing better financial products services. blog provides overview key changes introduced psd3, profound influence finance industry, specifically terms bolstering payment security fortifying fraud prevention measures. important note time blog, transition deadline technical details currently unknown. psd3: addressing changing market dynamics payments landscape undergone rapid transformation reaction global pandemic. value electronic payments eu steadily increasing, reaching €240 trillion 2021. digital technologies enabled innovative payment providers, including fintech firms, respond user demands faster payments p2p payment options smartphones. however, growth exposed consumers new forms fraud risks. key changes psd3 -

3 Steps For Reducing External Brand Threats | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/reducing-external-brand-threats,2021-02-20,"3 Steps For Reducing External Brand Threats
An organization’s brand is one of its most valuable assets – and one of the easiest targets for cybercriminals. Here are three steps an organization should implement to reduce the impact of external threats.
3 Steps For Reducing External Brand Threats
An organization’s brand is one of its most valuable assets – and one of the easiest targets for cybercriminals. Businesses must extend their security and fraud posture beyond traditional network monitoring to protect their brand from reputation, revenue, fraud and compliance risks.
That’s easier said than done: the global pandemic has accelerated organizations’ digital transformation and created new attack surfaces beyond the perimeter. Today, fraud, risk, and security teams are expected to protect an organization’s digital assets, customers, brand, and executive reputation across the surface, deep and dark web, social media, mobile app stores, and email. And they’re expected to do that despite a global cybersecurity skills shortage.
Organizations’ inability to properly monitor external threats across their digital footprint has increased their risk: this blind spot can compromise an organization’s (and its executives’) brand reputation; lead to fraud attacks (including phishing, malware, BEC); Account Takeover (ATO) attacks (credential compromise/theft); data leakage (IP, PII), and other major security, compliance, HR, marketing, and personnel issues.
Here are three steps an organization should implement to reduce the impact of external threats targeting your brand:
1. Identify the most valuable social media and digital assets associated with your brand. Start by listing your accounts and imagining if they were compromised, or if fake accounts impersonating your real corporate accounts were created. Consider what the impact on your brand and business would be, then prioritize your accounts accordingly.
2. Create a monitoring strategy, which should consist of:
- Domains & SSLs – Closely monitor newly registered domains and sub-domains associated with newly registered or newly updated SSL certificates
- Phishing Websites and Emails – Monitor for phishing sites, or websites that mimic your legitimate site and attempt to acquire sensitive personal information from your customers. Make sure to also look out for scams utilizing your brand, including Phishing, Smishing, Vishing, and Reverse Vishing.
- Mobile App Stores – Monitor mobile app stores to gain visibility and stay ahead of potential damage caused by unauthorized and unsupervised apps ‘associated’ with your brand.
- Social Media – Social media continues to be a highly used and highly targeted platform for cybercriminals to exploit. Monitoring social media platforms helps your organization understand if impersonation accounts were set up, or if fake promotions linked to malware or ransomware are misrepresenting your organization. Also, organizations should ensure their corporate social media posture has updated policies, employee trainings, regular audits and vulnerability assessments conducted to properly prepare for compliance reviews.
- Executives, board members, & VIPS – We are seeing many fake profiles created to impersonate organizations’ executive teams. This is typically the first step in a targeted spear phishing attack. By monitoring VIPs’ profiles, an organization can protect itself against business email compromise scams (BEC), spear phishing, impersonations, ATO, credential theft, and doxing extortion.
3. Establish a takedown process before you need it: If you uncover external threats targeting your brand, it’s critical to have a rapid takedown process on hand so you can act immediately. Here are some factors to consider if you’re developing this process:
- Qualify the scope of the attack: Ensure you identify any additional resources related to the attack, including redirections, frames, and drop points. Next, ensure you take down each of those resources.
- Contact all hosting authorities related to an attack: Attacks must be analyzed to determine all the involved authorities: ISP, webhosting, registrar, registrant, hijacked website owner, etc. Make sure to contact each authority.
- Follow-up and communicate in the local language with relevant authorities: In addition to the initial takedown request, follow-ups with the relevant authorities should be conducted along with the local CERT or Cyber Police. You will develop stronger relations and quicker response times if you communicate in agencies’ local languages.
- Create a customer communication plan: Remember, brand reputation attacks destroy customer trust. If an attack using your brand resulted in damage to your customers in any way – including identity theft, account takeover or fraudulent payments – then it’s critical you have a strong communication plan to sustain that trust and not lose future revenue.
These steps will allow you to increase your visibility into external digital threats and effectively manage your digital risk against fraud and brand abuse. Doing so will allow you to improve your customer experience, brand reputation, retention, revenue and trust by decreasing identity theft, account takeovers, and fraud incidents.

Outseer Report: Nearly Half of All Cyberattacks Involve Brand Impersonation | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/report-cyberattacks-involve-brand-impersonation,2021-10-05,"Outseer Report: Nearly Half of All Cyberattacks Involve Brand Impersonation
Here are our latest findings on brand abuse as transaction fraud. Read on to learn more from our analysis.
According to the latest quarterly analysis from Outseer’s FraudAction team, brand impersonation scams continue to exploit the sharp rise in digital banking and ecommerce during the pandemic.
While fraudsters have long masqueraded as Chase, Wells Fargo, Amazon, Microsoft and other trusted brands in attacks targeting consumers and businesses, these companies are hardly alone. As captured in our Q3 2021 Fraud & Payments Report, brand abuse is the fastest growing attack vector for transaction fraud for the third quarter in a row as threat actors switch up the tactics they use to impersonate brands both large and small.
The report features our analysis of more than 49,000 payments fraud attacks from April through June 2021. And it documents a troubling rise in the use of email and text phishing scams, fraudulent social media pages, and rogue mobile apps to impersonate trusted brands in order to harvest login and payment credentials from victims. So far this year, our data indicates brand abuse is a factor in nearly half (49%) of all cyberattacks worldwide.
Among our latest findings:
Phishing’s the Lure in Nearly 1 in 5 Attacks
Phishing accounted for more than 18% of all fraud attacks in Q2. In these social engineering attacks, perfect replicas of a brand’s password-change alerts to past-due notices are sent by email or text message. By activating our “lizard brain,” these seemingly urgent messages bamboozle recipients into clicking through to a fraudulent login screen and enter their login credentials. In Q2, a growing number of attacks involved phony social media pages (some created by bots) to lure consumers with phony sweepstakes and offers. Nearly 3 in 4 (72.5%) of these attacks were launched from US-based hosting services.
Counterfeit Apps Climb 66%
Cybercriminals increasingly distribute lookalike apps through the app stores run by Google, Apple, and other official app stores. Almost a third (30%) of all cyberattacks in the financial services sector during the second quarter of 2021 came from fraudulent banking apps. That’s a 66% increase in just 90 days. It’s also up 140% from the same period last year (Q2 2020). Malicious banking apps are often used to harvest login credentials for use in account takeover and new account creation schemes.
70% of Fraudulent Banking Transactions Are Mobile
The mobile channel is now the preferred choice for 77% of all digital banking transactions, whether via app or mobile web. But mobile transaction fraud is growing almost as quickly. During Q2, 70% of all fraudulent digital banking transactions originated in the mobile channel—mostly through mobile apps.
The High Cost of Brand Abuse
Brand abuse is big business. In 2020, the FBI received a record number of cyber-fraud complaints from US consumers and businesses, with reported losses exceeding $4.1 billion—a 69% increase in one year. Worldwide, losses may have topped $1 trillion. But if our data is any indication, that may have been just a warm-up act.
According to our analysis, the average value of a fraudulent banking transaction (money transfer, ACH, P2P, Wire) was $1,616 for the mobile channel and $5,158 for the desktop web during the second quarter. Which helps explain all the effort bad actors are putting into monetizing compromised credentials.
What’s worse: Those are just global averages. According to the Financial Times, individuals who fall prey to imposters posing as investment firms lose an average $61,278. But the price tag can go up astronomically from there. In attacks targeting businesses, for instances, harvested login credentials that lead to data breach can cost an average of $9.01 million per incident for US-based companies, according to Ponemon Institute’s 2021 Cost of a Data Breach Report.
Innocence May Not Matter
Oh, and if it’s your brand that gets impersonated through email or SMS phishing, social media, or bogus apps, don’t think innocence will spare you from paying a price, too. Reputational damage and loss of consumer trust can obliterate revenues generated from your own legitimate digital channels at the exact time you need them most.
In an economy where as much as 80% of market value stems from intangibles like brand equity and goodwill, organizations need to look beyond their perimeters to protect against reputational damage. Our own intelligence and cyberattack takedown service, for example, monitors the web, app stores, and social media platforms 24/7 to detect and shut down brandjacking attacks before they cause serious harm. Along with anti-fraud products leveraging the EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS) protocol, companies can equip themselves against fraudulent transactions stemming from these attacks as well.

In today’s increasingly digital world, businesses face a significant challenge in protecting themselves and their customers from fraudsters. Traditional fraud prevention solutions often fall short of keeping up with the ever-evolving tactics fraudsters use. However, Outseer’s Global Data Network presents a ground-breaking approach to fraud prevention by harnessing the power of a data consortium. This article will explore the advantages of using a data consortium in fraud prevention and highlight the uniqueness of Outseer’s offering in the market.
Understanding Data Consortium
A data consortium is a collaborative effort where multiple organizations come together and pool their data resources to create a comprehensive and powerful dataset. When combined with advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities, this aggregated data enables businesses to identify and prevent fraudulent activities more effectively.
Leveraging Data Consortium in Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance: Enhancing Fraud Prevention and Risk Management
- Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) – FS-ISAC is a global non-profit organization that facilitates the sharing of cybersecurity threat intelligence among financial institutions. It operates as a data consortium, where participating banks and financial institutions collaborate to exchange information about cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices. By pooling their resources and knowledge, FS-ISAC members enhance their ability to detect and prevent cyber-attacks.
- The Global Coalition to Fight Financial Crime (GCFFC) – GCFFC is an initiative launched by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with major global banks and financial institutions, law enforcement agencies, and regulatory bodies. The coalition aims to create a data consortium that facilitates sharing of financial crime-related data. By combining resources and expertise, GCFFC seeks to enhance the effectiveness of anti-money laundering (AML) efforts, combat terrorist financing, and improve overall financial system integrity.
- Singapore’s National Digital Identity (NDI) Program – The Singaporean government is implementing the National Digital Identity program to establish a trusted and secure digital identity infrastructure for its citizens and businesses. As part of this initiative, various government agencies, financial institutions, and service providers are collaborating to build a data consortium. This consortium will securely share verified identity information, enabling smoother and more secure digital transactions while reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud.
- European DataWarehouse (EDW) – EDW is a data consortium established to support the securitization market in Europe. It serves as a central repository for asset-backed securities data, bringing together originators, investors, and regulators. The consortium allows participants to pool data related to securitized assets, enabling better risk assessment, transparency, and regulatory compliance. By aggregating and analyzing the data, EDW enhances market transparency and contributes to more effective risk management in the securitization sector.
- In countries where data consortiums are not utilized in fraud prevention or where local fraud prevention solutions lack a data consortium infrastructure, data sharing in the banking and financial services sector, as exemplified by India’s Account Aggregator framework, plays a crucial role in combating financial crimes such as anti-money laundering (AML) and the movement of funds by criminal organizations and terrorists. While the primary focus of data sharing is to combat financial crime and enhance services, it also holds untapped potential in addressing fraud. Collaborative data sharing among financial institutions enables early detection of fraudulent activities, reduces response times, and enhances overall security. By implementing data sharing to combat fraud, the industry can strengthen its security measures and ensure the integrity of the financial system
Advantages of Data Consortium in Fraud Prevention

Command & Control Servers: The Rise of the Hook | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/rise-of-the-hook,2024-01-31,"Command & Control Servers: The Rise of the Hook
Introduction
Over the last months of 2023, a notable event has taken place in the realm of mobile malware — the complete leak of the Hook Android banking trojan’s APK and Panel source code. This significant development is not only shaping the current landscape but also holds implications that are about to influence the future of Android banking trojans.
Brief History
In January 2023 a known actor nicknamed “DukeEugene” advertised the renting services of a new software targeting Android devices. This software was later that month reported by ThreatFabric and dubbed as “Hook”.
Post in fraud forum Translated from Russian by DukeEugene advertising Hook
Hook is an Android banking trojan a direct descendant of the “Ermac” banking trojan designed to steal financial and personal information from mobile devices running the Android operating system. Armed with advanced capabilities, Hook encompasses contact harvesting, SMS interception, keylogging, capture 2FA, RAT capabilities, overlay injection, and more.
One of the key aspects of the Hook and Android banking trojans in general, is the communication established between infected devices and the centralized or decentralized servers known as Command-and-Control Servers (C&Cs or C2). This gives malware operators the ability to receive information on infected devices and execute additional commands remotely.
Outseer FraudAction ATS (Anti Trojan Service) team constantly monitors these C&Cs. Notably, for the first half-year of 2023, the number of active Hook C&C servers remained relatively low compared to other well-known banking trojans like Alien, Hydra, and Octo. For a detailed exploration of the first half of 2023, please refer to Hunting The Command & Control Servers: Android Banking Trojans In the First Half of 2023.
Hook C&C Panel
In April 2023 DukeEugene announced that he was leaving for military service and is closing the Hook project. However, the project’s coder, known as ‘RedDragon,’ has continued to provide services for existing customers.”
DukeEugene advertising that the project is closed translated from Russian
Fast forward three months to July 2023, a threat intelligence researcher known as “0xperator” tweeted that the HookBot builder panel code had been leaked. However, at that time, certain features were notably absent. It wasn’t until the 30th of October that the entire code was fully leaked.
0xperator tweet of HookBot leaked source code
User discussing recent leaks in fraud forum
The source code leaked allows malware operators to set up and run the C&C server on a publicly available address and create a Hook malware App disguised as a legitimate-looking application in a matter of minutes. The App created has the necessary functionalities to communicate with the created C&C server. As a result, the malware operator can now focus primarily on spreading the malware.
Hook Builder Panel
These events led to massive growth in HookBot C&Cs with over 200 new C&Cs detected in the last couple of months of 2023. With intermediate tech knowledge and without the burden of rental fees, fraudsters now have the option to utilize Hook as a tool for carrying out fraudulent activities. Notably, not only have ‘newcomers’ adopted Hook, but we’ve also identified customized variants of HookBot panels and their favicon web titles that bear a resemblance to the names of well-known groups and threat actors who typically employ other types of malwares.
Customized Hook panels and Hook panel titles
While we cannot confirm a definitive link between the identified resembling names and their associated actors, one case did catch our attention as particularly interesting. We’ve observed a pattern where various Hook samples, named ‘MOD’ or ‘Мод,’ share identical app icons and exclusively communicate with C&C panels featuring the name MOD. This distinctive name and icon correspond precisely to the app icon and name that an actor we name “7key7″* has been using for years while operating or renting this version of Cerberus malware.
List of malicious APK samples named MOD and Мод
Hook MOD payload configured to a MOD C&C panel address.
Another distinctive trait that led us to suspect that 7key7 has begun utilizing Hook is the absence in use of the overlay injection feature in both the Cerberus and Hook C&C servers operated by 7key7, distinguishing them from the rest of the Hook and Cerberus-related C&Cs.
By default, Hook has over 750 injections at its disposal, where infected devices overlay a fake interface of a targeted brand onto the legitimate app to deceive users into entering their sensitive financial information, targeting different brands worldwide. Moreover, the malware operator can add customized injections if desired. (Contact Outseer to see if your brand is on the targeted list)
Proactive Approach to Safeguard against Future Hook Variants
The threat posed by Android banking trojans continues to grow, with new variants emerging annually. The story of Hook is far from concluded. As both emerging and established actors increasingly leverage Hook to pursue fraudulent objectives, Outseer anticipates seeing new variants based on Hook in the future, each potentially endowed with enhanced functionalities and more dangerous capabilities. It is crucial to hunt, detect, and terminate these malicious servers. With over 20 years of experience and collaborative efforts with various web entities, FraudAction is equipped to swiftly terminate the threat and protect users and organizations from the damaging consequences of Android banking trojans.

Top Strategies for Risk-Based Transaction Monitoring | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/risk-based-monitoring,2021-10-21,"Top Strategies for Risk-Based Transaction Monitoring
Wondering about risk-based monitoring? We explain what transaction monitoring is, how risk-based monitoring works, and the benefits of a risk-based approach.
What Is Risk-Based Transaction Monitoring?
Transaction monitoring refers to the monitoring of all customer transactions. A risk-based approach requires more intensive monitoring for clients or scenarios that have a higher risk.
By analyzing the risk of each transaction, businesses can protect themselves from fraud while preserving the customer experience. For example, in eCommerce businesses, owners not only fight fraud but continuously work to improve their conversion rates and reduce cart abandonment.
Risk-based transaction monitoring provides more transparency about purchases by monitoring customer behaviors and assigns appropriate responses based on the level of risk. Suspicious transactions may be sent through a challenge flow, while legitimate customers continue their checkout unimpeded. This is called a frictionless flow, and it’s one of many reasons why risk-based monitoring is so effective at preventing fraud.
How Does Risk-based Monitoring Work?
Overview
At a high level, risk-based monitoring relies on statistical analysis and data models to identify fraud. These models are continuously fed data on legitimate and fraudulent transactions so that the algorithm can learn the difference between the two.
Risk-based monitoring compares each transaction to statistical models and assigns the transaction a risk score based on the behavior of the user. Important metrics such as device ID, IP address, transaction volume, and account age are considered when assigning a risk score. Organizations can configure different flows for transactions that reach certain risk scores and customize their fraud prevention system to suit their risk tolerance and company policies.
Building Risk Models
Developing effective risk-based monitoring requires large amounts of data and finely tuned machine learning techniques to score each transaction accurately. Analyzing a diversity of data points is key to understanding user behavior.
Many risk-based systems gather data, including the following:
- Transaction amount, history, and frequency
- Device IP address, screen resolution, browser fingerprinting, and device ID
- Geolocation, MAC address, and indicators of device emulation
- Signs of automation, bot activity, and malware
- Authentication results, channel, and internal intelligence
This data helps determine an accurate risk score, and it’s key to developing identity science tools that prevent account takeover fraud and new account fraud. To stay effective in the wake of new threats, risk-based monitoring leverages global intelligence networks to continuously monitor the threat landscape.
Systems like the Outseer Global Network have thousands of contributing organizations across 150 countries, including law enforcement agencies and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). As members confirm genuine and fraudulent transactions, the data from those transactions are shared across the network. This adjusts the risk score automatically for all Outseer customers and helps prevent new and unrecognized methods of fraud.
Risk Scoring Methods
Once data is collected, statistical analysis is applied to calculate the risk score. This involves calculating the conditional probability of an action being fraudulent and analyzing the known factors and predictors using machine learning. Machine learning algorithms provide a flexible and transparent way to assess risk and accurately develop risk scores. Using the correct technology to score risk is a common challenge when tackling fraud.
Rule-based methods are static, meaning they don’t learn over time as data changes or threats adapt. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) work in a similar manner to machine learning but fail to work accurately with small data sets. A fundamental flaw with ANNs is their lack of transparency, which is vital when understanding how a risk assessment was generated.
You can think of ANNs as black boxes, where data is fed into one end and comes out the other. This is a problem because there’s no way to visualize the contributing factors or understand what factors weighed most to create the risk score. Inaccurate risk scoring can negatively impact the customer experience and leave the door open for fraud.
Proprietary machine learning algorithms like the Outseer Risk Engine take all factors into consideration and use the most predictive factors to provide transparent and accurate scoring. By processing over 100 different fraud indicators, the risk engine determines the relative risk based on device and behavioral profiling. This data is further enriched through the Outseer Global Data Network to provide the most accurate assessment possible.
Risk-based Actions
Once risk is identified, actions can be applied to block blatant fraud and filter highly suspicious transactions. This is known as a challenge flow, which requires the user to authenticate themselves in some way. Organizations using the Outseer Fraud Manager can pick from out-of-the-box step-up authentication methods or use their own.
Step-up verification often uses phone calls, text messages, or emails to confirm a user’s identity. Biometric authentication such as fingerprint and speech recognition can also be used to identify users. The benefit of step-up authentication is that it only applies to suspicious transactions, leaving real customers uninterrupted. This frictionless approach improves the user experience and is a core component of combating eCommerce fraud.
Outseer Solution
Understanding the nuances of risk-based monitoring can be overwhelming. That’s why major credit card companies, financial services firms, and payment processors count on Outseer to protect themselves and the businesses they serve.
Unlike traditional fraud monitoring methods, Outseer reads between the lines to understand how real customers behave compared to fraudsters—stopping 95% of all fraud loss with only 5% of transactions ever requiring intervention.

Rogue Apps: What They Are & Top Techniques to Prevent Them | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/rogue-apps,2022-02-22,"Rogue Apps: What They Are & Top Techniques to Prevent Them
Wondering about rogue apps? We explain what they are, what they do, and how to protect your business and your customers from the significant damage they can cause.
What Are Rogue Apps?
Rogue apps are mobile apps designed to impersonate trusted brands, with the goal of gaining unauthorized access to information that can be used to commit fraudulent transactions.
These malicious apps can install malware, ransomware, or trick users into sending their payment details to attackers. Fraudsters sometimes create rogue apps that simply do nothing but charge the user for the download.
For example, cybercriminals will clone a brand’s free app and simply upload it to the app store as a paid product. In one recent study, 134 such “fleeceware” apps were collectively downloaded from the App Store and Google Play Store, racking up $38.5 million in revenue for fraudsters by charging subscription fees that can cost individuals as much as $3,432 per year.
While app stores and cell phone manufacturers try to prevent the distribution and download of rogue apps, it’s often a cat-and-mouse game that can leave both brands and customers vulnerable.
The crime rings behind these fraudulent branded apps are growing increasingly sophisticated. In one recent case, a slew of different apps were used to steal the user’s login credentials for banking, cryptocurrency, and payment apps, along with email and general purpose apps. The malware used to accomplish this wasn’t added until after the app been downloaded and in use for some time.
According to Outseer’s own data, the number of rogue mobile apps uploaded to popular app stores jumped nearly 50% during the third quarter of 2021, and now account for 39% of all fraud attacks worldwide.
What Do Rogue Apps Do?
Rogue apps are generally used by cybercriminals to pilfer money, either through fraudulent app sales or from stolen information. As more app stores crack down on their upload policies, cybercriminals are employing more dubious tactics.
For instance, a malicious shopping app can detect which banking apps the victim has on their phone. When they go to open one of those banking apps, an exact copy of the app home screen is displayed over the real app. When the victim enters their account information, it is submitted to the real banking app and the criminals behind the scenes.
Alternatively, rogue apps can scare unsuspecting users into opening the door for attackers. Some malicious programs can display pop-ups and block out portions of the screen with messages stating the device has been hacked.
These messages often include a download link for a cleanup tool or phone number for support. The “cleanup” tool is typically a piece of malware that is not approved or hosted on the app store. This malware can steal sensitive information to be used for further blackmail or ransom.
Detecting these attacks can be extremely difficult when traditional security measures fail. Victims typically feel frustrated and often blame the impersonated brand, even when the brand was unaware of the attack.
How Do Rogue Apps Work?
Rogue apps can range in complexity depending on who develops them. Common fraudsters often create fake apps that send pop-ups or display ads. These pop-ups usually direct the victim to a malicious site or pay the fraudster for every impression they receive.
Organized crime and even nation-states use highly sophisticated rogue apps to steal information and spy on users. These attacks tend to be less frequent but are devastating once discovered. Entire dark web marketplaces revolve around selling exploits that criminals can use to install rogue apps without setting off any alarms.
In many cases, these apps rely on tricking the user into handing over more permissions than needed. For instance, if you download a weather app it might ask for a list of permissions. Many people simply click yes but fail to realize they just handed over access to all of their contacts and text messages.
These rogue mobile apps are available from both legitimate sources such as the App Store and Play Store, as well as fake sites that mimic the looks of these trusted app repositories. Phishing scams and fraudulent social media pages are often used to promote these links. And with the resurgence in popularity in QR codes like the one used in the 2022 Super Bowl, the FBI is warning consumers and businesses that these 2-D codes will be used to point unsuspecting users to these fraudulent apps.
Once installed, some of the more advanced apps go to work to hide traces of themselves. It’s common to see rogue apps remove their icons and disappear from the installed app list. Finding evidence of these apps can be tough and often requires technical experience to dig through the running background services on the device.
Signs You’re Infected with a Rogue App
Both Android and iOS devices can fall victim to rogue apps. While the malware may vary, you’ll often see the same symptoms. You might have a rogue app on your phone if you experience the following:
- You’re constantly seeing ads or pop-ups across all your apps
- Your battery drains faster than normal
- You see apps on your phone you don’t recognize
- Your app icon disappears after installation
If you’re experiencing one or more of these signs, have your phone looked at by an expert you trust or a technician with your carrier. In some cases, apps can obtain system-level or admin permissions to prevent themselves from being removed. If this is the case, reach out to an IT professional as soon as possible.
Removing Rogue Apps from Your Device
Consider seeking expert advice before attempting to remove any applications. It’s best practice to have the device looked at by a professional to verify if there is a problem and where it resides. While there are numerous mobile security apps, restoring your device to its factory default is the safest move.
Complex rogue apps can sometimes clone and hide in different places inside your device. Simply uninstalling the app might not fully remove the infection. Resetting to the factory default wipes the slate clean and allows you to start from scratch again.
Removing Rogue Apps from the App Store
Businesses that find that their brand is being impersonated can contact the app store directly to remove the app. The Play Store has a form where you can request an app removal or rejection. Both Google and Apple have very specific guidelines for developers in terms of impersonation and misleading users.
This removal process can take time, which unfortunately leaves your customers vulnerable for longer than necessary. With nearly three million apps on Google Play alone, manually patrolling for fraudsters is impractical, if not impossible.
If your brand is vulnerable or under attack, you’re advised to source a comprehensive, 24/7 cyberattack detection and takedown service that continuously monitors the cybercrime landscape to identify rogue mobile apps and other threats. When fraud is detected, an immediate takedown order is sent to the app store to ensure minimal brand damage.
How to Defend Against Rogue Apps
Rogue apps are bad news for both consumers and brands. Thankfully, there are a few tools and techniques you can use to protect yourself.
Businesses can protect their brand from rogue apps by doing the following:
- Searching their brand name across app stores for malicious entries
- Implement brand monitoring and automatic rogue app takedown services
- Be proactive in alerting staff and customers to impersonation attempts
- Use data science and machine learning to prevent brand impersonation
Individuals can protect themselves from rogue apps by doing the following:
- Review your app’s permissions (Does a game have access to your text messages?)
- Only install apps from your app marketplace (Play Store/Apple Store)
- Read the reviews—avoid apps with thousands of five-star reviews but no written comments
- Avoid apps with one-star reviews with negative comments, especially the word “scam”
- Bypass the “helpful” reviews and read both positive and poor reviews
- Never give an app more permissions than it needs

CYBERWARFARE: How the Russia-Ukraine Crisis Threatens Cybersecurity Worldwide | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/russia-cyberwar,2022-03-03,"CYBERWARFARE: How the Russia-Ukraine Crisis Threatens Cybersecurity Worldwide
A NEW ERA OF CYBERWAR HAS BEGUN
On February 24, Russian forces launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine that was predated by a series of cyberattacks targeting critical Ukrainian government, banking, and communications infrastructure.
In response to the pre-invasion cyber-assault, Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov took to Twitter to call for the creation of a global “IT army” to combat Russia’s formidable cyber forces. Within hours, posts in numerous hacking forums rallied for counterstrikes targeting Russian assets.
Combined with some of the most comprehensive economic sanctions ever imposed on a rogue nation, cyberattacks by and against Russian forces are already cascading beyond Russian and Ukrainian borders.
In fact, the conflict represents what Harvard Business Review calls the most acute cyber risk U.S. and western corporations have ever faced. The following assessment of cyberattacks observed in the earliest days of the conflict suggests organizations should prepare for varied and rapidly-evolving cyberthreats in coming weeks.
DDoS Attacks
Beginning February 23, DDoS attacks against Ukrainian government and infrastructure websites caused widespread disruption of web resources belonging to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Verkhovna Rada, among others—prompting the Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister’s call to action.
The announcement sparked robust chatter in underground forums and groups, with most supporting Ukraine and its efforts to repel Russia’s cyber-assaults. And that chatter soon turned to action.
On February 26, the prominent hacker group known as “Anonymous” launched #OpRussia to unleash massive DDoS attacks against Russian domains, along with large-scale leaks of private Russian data. Within hours, it is believed the coordinated effort succeeded in taking down the Kremlin’s official website along with those of Russian president Vladimir Putin, the Russian Ministry of Defense, and the Russian Parliament (aka the Duma). Nonetheless, Russia vast network of state-sponsored threat actors continue to launch new attacks.
Phishing Campaigns
On February 25th, Ukraine’s CERT reported “mass phishing emails” targeting the private “i.ua” and “meta.ua” accounts of Ukrainian military personnel and related individuals. After an account is infiltrated, the attackers gain access to all archived and incoming messages. Leveraging contact details from the victim’s address book, they can then send new phishing emails to laterally expand the network of compromised accounts. CERT UA identified the attackers as The Minsk-based group ‘UNC1151’. Its members are officers of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus.
Emerging Malware Threats
Russian hacker groups are well-known for developing malware for use in attacks worldwide. In the last few days, cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new data-wiping malware, dubbed HermeticaWiper (AKA KillDisk.NCV), that has been deployed against Ukrainian targets and is believed to have been created just within the last two months. Additionally, Conti Group, an infamous Russian ransomware gang, threatened last Friday in a dark web blog post to use its full force and hack the critical infrastructure of any nation or organization that attempts to target Russia.
PREPARING FOR A WIDENING BLAST RADIUS
As this is a developing situation, it is unclear what impact this cyberwarfare may have on the rest of the world.
But the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued a warning that the damaging economic sanctions and other measures being imposed on Russia are likely to result in cyberattacks against western targets.
It is important to be mindful that this cyberwarfare could expand in unpredictable ways.
As a precaution, US, British, and Australian cyber agencies are warning public- and private-sector cybersecurity personnel to be vigilant and prepare for possible retaliatory nation-state phishing, malware, and direct cyberattacks that could result in significant and prolonged business disruptions.",,"malware, phishing, ransomware",3,2022-03-03,"CYBERWARFARE: How the Russia-Ukraine Crisis Threatens Cybersecurity Worldwide | Outseer.

In the age of rapid technological progress, the surge in cybercrime presents a growing concern. Among the foremost cyber threats is malware, a malevolent software engineered to infiltrate systems and steal sensitive data. This blog focuses on malware, delving into recent malware incidents and spotlighting the contributions of Outseer FraudAction in combatting stolen credentials. Moreover, it will highlight and educate you on the unsettling phenomenon known as “Malware as a Service,” and scrutinizes recent news coverage that underscores the ever-evolving landscape of cyber dangers.
Malware and Its Consequences
Malware, an abbreviation for malicious software, encompasses a range of software programs constructed with malicious intent. A particularly disconcerting facet of malware is its knack for compromising sensitive information, be it passwords, financial particulars, or cryptocurrency assets. Recent incidents emphasize the gravity of the threat emanating from malware, as hackers launch sweeping campaigns aimed at vulnerable systems and devices.
The Campaign Targeting Mac Systems
In a recent turn of events, hackers have initiated an expansive campaign directed at Mac computers. This campaign harnesses a fresh strain of Mac malware dubbed “Realst.” The malware’s mission is to take (or steal!) passwords, cryptocurrency, and other confidential data from unsuspecting victims. “Realst” spreads through dishonest manoeuvres, including the promotion of counterfeit blockchain games on social media platforms. Initially promoted as game downloads, access codes are employed not only to dupe victims but also to enable hackers to identify high-value targets for their assaults.
Windows Users Under Siege
This threat is not confined to Mac users; Windows users are equally in the firing line. The same campaign sets its sights on Windows systems, utilizing the “RedLine Stealer” malware, which shares comparable functionalities with “Realst.” Regardless of the operating system, users are admonished to exercise caution when procuring software from unofficial sources. This caution extends to households with young gamers, who might unknowingly facilitate the propagation of malware.
The Emergence of “Statc Stealer”
Adding to the mounting fears, and the ever-growing tools available, a new information-harvesting malware variant named “Statc Stealer” has come to light. This malware exhibits the capacity to extract an extensive array of sensitive information, spanning from login credentials to cryptocurrency wallet data. Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers underscore the broad spectrum of data stealing capabilities demonstrated by “Statc Stealer.” Its targeting of web browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, passwords, and messaging applications underscores its potency as a menace.
The Malware Market and the Ascent of “Malware as a Service”

Safeguarding Financial Data: The Importance of Data Protection | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/safeguarding-financial-data-the-importance-of-data-protection,2023-08-30,"Safeguarding Financial Data: The Importance of Data Protection
In today’s digital age, financial institutions and organizations handle vast amounts of sensitive data, making data protection a critical concern. With cyber threats becoming increasingly sophisticated, the need to safeguard financial data has never been more crucial. This blog post explores the significance of data protection for financial data and provides essential insights into best practices that can help mitigate risks and ensure the security of valuable information.
The Value of Financial Data
Financial data encompasses a wide range of information, including personal and sensitive details such as bank account numbers, credit card information, social security numbers, and transaction records. This data holds immense value to both individuals and organizations, making it an attractive target for cybercriminals. The potential consequences of data breaches include financial loss, identity theft, damaged reputation, legal ramifications, and regulatory non-compliance.
Compliance with Regulatory Standards
Data protection for financial data is not just a matter of good practice; it is also mandated by various regulatory frameworks. Governments and regulatory bodies have established guidelines and laws to ensure the security and privacy of financial information. For instance, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) impose strict requirements on financial institutions and merchants to protect customer data.
Vulnerabilities and Threat Landscape
Financial institutions and their supply chain face a range of threats, including hackers, malware, phishing attacks, and insider threats. The increasing interconnectedness of systems, reliance on third-party vendors, and the proliferation of mobile and cloud technologies further expand the attack surface. It is essential to understand these vulnerabilities and proactively implement robust security measures to counteract potential threats.
Best Practices for Data Protection
- Encryption: Encrypting financial data both in transit and at rest helps protect against unauthorized access. Utilizing strong encryption algorithms and ensuring encryption keys are properly managed are crucial aspects of a comprehensive data protection strategy.
- Access Controls: Implement strict access controls to limit data access to authorized personnel only. Two-factor authentication, role-based access controls, and regular permissions and access reviews are effective mechanisms for controlling data exposure.
- Regular Auditing and Monitoring: Establish a system for continuous monitoring and auditing of financial data. This helps detect any unusual activity, potential breaches, or unauthorized access, enabling organizations to respond swiftly and mitigate risks promptly.
- Employee Training and Awareness: Educate employees about data protection best practices, the importance of secure passwords, and the risks associated with phishing and social engineering attacks. Regular training sessions and awareness campaigns can significantly strengthen the overall security posture.
- Incident Response Plan: Develop a robust incident response plan that outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a data breach. This includes the assignment of roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and coordination with relevant authorities to minimize the impact and ensure a timely response.
- Data Backup and Recovery: Implement regular backup routines to safeguard financial data. Maintain off-site backups in secure locations to protect against data loss due to unforeseen events such as natural disasters or hardware failures. Regular testing of backup restoration processes is crucial to ensure data integrity.
Protecting financial data is a paramount concern for organizations operating in today’s data-driven world. By adhering to robust data protection practices, including encryption, access controls, employee training, and incident response planning, financial institutions can mitigate risks and safeguard valuable data. Staying abreast of emerging technologies and industry best practices ensures organizations remain one step

Scam Mitigation Quick Guide: Your Journey to Protection | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/scam-mitigation-quick-guide-your-journey-to-protection,2023-08-15,"Scam Mitigation Quick Guide: Your Journey to Protection
Over the past few years, Outseer has observed a significant uptick in authorised push payments, mule accounts, and account takeovers within the industry. This has been dramatically influenced thanks to the changes in our own personal lives and spending but also the ecosystem itself. Fraudsters have latched onto these changes by focusing their attacks more on the emotional side of an individual, thus creating a challenge for banks and merchants to prevent such cases from happening.
To fully understand authorised push payments and mule account scams we need to go back to the start, where the fraud begins. These types of attacks rely on the fraudster knowing personal information about your customers. To do this they will need to perform either a phishing attack or buy/obtain the information from elicit sources like the dark web.
Fraudsters mainly employ three data-gathering techniques:
- Phishing – sending deceptive emails that appear to originate from a trusted/genuine source to influence or gain personal data.
- Vishing – eliciting information or attempting to influence action via the telephone, may include other tools such as ‘phone spoofing’ technology.
- Impersonation – Posing as someone else to obtain information or access to a specific person, company, or computer system.
Once the fraudster has obtained personal information about your customer, it becomes easier for them to forge connections, enhancing their credibility. For example, a fraudster who calls a customer by their first name and confirms whom they bank with, and other personal information will always seem more genuine than a cold call, where the fraudster has nothing to connect with the customer.
Below summaries how the data is gathered:
As indicated by Datos Insights, (formerly Aite-Novarica), research Faster Payments, Faster Fraud report (published on May 2023), the consumer is the weakest link as fraudsters have developed a tried-and-true playbook and have replicated this attack vector across multiple geographies. The challenges with stopping fraudsters from obtaining such personal information rely heavily on customers being vigilant and educated about potential threats. Regrettably, educational resources often become available too late—usually when the fraudster is already in conversation with the client other challenges in detecting social engineering include:
- Expansive attack vectors.
- There’s no need for advanced hacking techniques.
- Social Engineering is now available on a “for hire” basis
- Exploitation of human emotions such as fear, urgency, and greed.
- General human fallibility.
- Inadequate social engineering training.
- Lack of data.
- Over-reliance on trusted partner.
All of these combined allow fraudsters to be successful with social engineering scams.
Once the fraudster has obtained the personal identifiable information (PII) from the customer this is where they will use it to exploit funds from the customer’s accounts. This is normally done in 3 ways:
The first layer in your scam mitigation strategy should be to limit the credentials and PII of your customers that fraudsters can access. Outseer FraudAction service can help you do just that.
The second phase in your scam mitigation journey is tracking scams. Today, many FIs do not track this type of fraud but you can’t fight what you don’t track so for a start it is recommended that FIs will tag these types of attacks so they can better analyse their characteristics and mitigate them more efficiently. For this purpose, Outseer Fraud Manager’s July 2023 release included new capabilities to its case management application, you can tag a case as a “scam” and then filter based on this tag. This can help you characterize the attributes of a scam attack and fine-tune your policies to more effectively counter these attacks.
Genuine user behaviour often disguises fraudulent activities. As part of Outseer’s Fraud Manager we decided to enable our customers to introduce smart friction and ask contextual questions to their users about how they feel, do they feel confident, and whether they are receiving advice or guidance over the phone. Below is an example of how we can help your organisation protect your customers from making a costly mistake in the payment transfer flow:
Another crucial layer involves sharing fraud data/signals across organisations. Outseer Global Data Network helps our customers fight fraud as a community. When one of the community members marks a transaction as fraudulent the transaction data is shared across our network.
To help our customers apply their own business risk acceptance the Outseer policy manager has specific rules that focus on such scams. Examples of these could be an increase in payment velocity, the sum of payments received from a specific payee and other anomaly detection capabilities. Outseer has designed the solution to be as flexible as possible to cater to our customer’s varying business needs.
As fraudsters continue to evolve the way they manipulate customers, we at Outseer are committed to evolving our solutions to address these challenges. We believe our ongoing development efforts will empower our customers/you to say one stead ahead of fraudsters.

"Scan & Scam: QR Codes, Touchless Payments & CNP Fraud | Outseer",https://www.outseer.com/blog/scan-and-scam-qr-codes,2021-09-16,"Scan & Scam: QR Codes, Touchless Payments & CNP Fraud
Consumers and businesses had better be prepared for the rising risks of account takeover and CNP fraud that come with QR Codes.
QR Codes may be an increasingly common point of convenience in touchless payments, but consumers and businesses had better be prepared for the rising risks of account takeover and CNP fraud that come with them.
Short for “quick response,” QR codes—those quirky, black-and-white squares you scan with your smartphone—are 2-D barcodes used to instantly access product information, download coupons, dial up a call center, board an airplane, or make direct purchases. First popularized in Japan nearly 30 years ago, they’ve gained new traction in the COVID era. Restaurants and retailers worldwide have been adding these little markers to a growing number of other touchless payment options to help customers avoid germ-laden surfaces.
They’re a hit with shoppers and patrons. According to ThreatPost, 47% of consumers in the US and UK report an increase in their QR code use during the pandemic. About 84% have scanned a QR code in the past year, with 32% having done so in just the last week. Sixty-four percent say they make life easier in a don’t-touch world.
But QR codes also come with dangers. For one thing, they present a tempting new attack vector for fraudsters who’ve stepped up phishing scams across email, SMS, social media, and more. But because they initiate immediate action, QR codes may be vulnerable to especially onerous threats.
QR Codes: Caveat Emptor
To most of us, QR codes all look the same, so it’s hard to verify if the QR code you’re scanning is legitimately from the business, or if a bad actor has replaced it and is misdirecting customers to a phishing site or initiating a fraudulent payment. While it may not seem like a big deal, even an email address can prove value for fraudsters on the dark web. So what about a direct link to the personal device in the hands of virtually every man, woman, and child?
The Better Business Bureau, for instance, is warning that malicious QR codes are being used to point consumers toward phishing sites that prompt you to enter personal information, download malware, or follow fraudulent social media accounts, or launch payment apps. Additionally, the BBB says bitcoin addresses are often sent via QR codes, which means QR codes are now an element of cryptocurrency scams.
Specifically, things consumers should watch out for QR codes that:
- Appear to be tampered with, or appear to be affixed as a sticker over an existing QR code
- Are printed on flyers or other easily-replicable material that could be produced by fraudsters
- Points the user’s browser to shortened URL when scanned; it could be hiding a malicious link
The BBA also advises that consumers install a QR code scanner with anti-virus capabilities to check the safety of scanned links before they’re opened. But fair warning: Consumers aren’t the only ones who should be on the lookout.
CNP and ATO Fraud: Protecting Your Business
As touchless tech and mobile payments become more prevalent, businesses should be aware of the different types of fraud that can occur when using QR codes—and how they can take measures to prevent fraudsters from gaining access to sensitive customer information or payment details.
Card Not Present (CNP) and Account Takeover (ATO) fraud, for instance, are two types of risk that can root from QR code vulnerabilities. These types of attacks can occur when bad actors use QR codes to impersonate a brand or business in order to collect customer information such as login credentials and email addresses that can then be used in an account takeover attack, or credit card numbers or using payment data for card not present or online payment fraud.
Losses from card-not-present (CNP) fraud alone topped $6.4 billion in 2020—and could increase another 16.4% by year’s end. Meanwhile, account takeover (ATO) attacks accounted for another $16 billion in loss in just the U.S. last year, up 300% from 2019.
To prevent attacks like these, businesses can add validation and verification steps to login ports accessed through QR code scans. They can also use anti-fraud products that leverage geolocation and behavioral data to help identify fraudulent activity and suspicious logins.
The Keys to Fraud Prevention
One key is to choose options that accurately detect these forms of fraud without causing false positives or slowing down legitimate customers.
Our own solution, for instance, leverages the EMV® 3-D Secure protocol to authenticate users transparently, and goes beyond measuring logins and activities against legitimate customer purchase behaviors at the stores, restaurants, and other businesses they frequent.
By augmenting this information with identity and transaction data from every industry and geography worldwide, we’re able to prevent 95% of all fraud loss while interrupting just 5% of transactions and logins for further scrutiny. That’s the best performance in the industry. But in our view, it’s also just the beginning.
That’s because customers who fall victim to ATO or CNP fraud won’t just fault the perpetrators. They’ll blame the brand or business for failing to protect them. To maximize anti-fraud efforts, we also offer services that detect and take down the phishing sites, fraudulent social media pages, and imposter mobile apps used in these attacks.
Bottom line: QR codes can add a whole new level of ease and convenience for tough-averse customers—as long as they’re fast, frictionless, and secure.

From forest fires to a pandemic, from election uncertainty to an economic recession, 2020 has been a year of unexpected disasters on an unprecedented scale.
Securing eCommerce During the Holiday Season and Beyond
From forest fires to a pandemic, from election uncertainty to an economic recession, 2020 has been a year of unexpected disasters on an unprecedented scale. Cybercriminals and fraudsters came out in force this year, in part because defenders were put on their heels with new baselines as well as very different work, school and home environments. We’ve never asked security teams to defend a perimeter as wide, wild, and intertwined as what they were defending this year: 2020 saw mundane attacks (including more DDoS and Phishing attacks) as well more subtle, damaging, and expensive ransomware attacks that targeted eCommerce and Healthcare.
On the lighter side, there’s talk of a “new normal” in homes and businesses worldwide. The global response to the pandemic has led to a radically “at home” world; the World Economic Forum found that productivity has remained stable despite the shift to remote work, and in some cases has even increased. Microsoft, Twitter, Nationwide Insurance, and many other organizations have announced that remote work will be a permanent fixture going forward. With several vaccines in development that could bring us out of lockdowns and quarantines, the question of everyone’s minds is how widespread these changes could be. We’ve gone from the old world of offices with some remote to work-from-home and now, potentially, work-from-anywhere.
2020 isn’t done though! The annual cadence of shorter days in the northern hemisphere also brings a crucial season for retail before the darkest months of the year, both literally and figuratively. This Black Friday in the United States was one of the worst on record for brick-and-mortar stores due to fear of contagion and social distancing rules. Many stores offered major discounts in a desperate effort to recoup Black Friday revenue with Cyber Monday (and ultimately ‘Cyber Week’) deals. The truth is that shopping on Cyber Monday has been trending up for years in the U.S., rivaling Black Friday in terms of sales volumes. The same was true this November during Singles’ Day in China, when local consumers spent a record ~$74 billion, according to Alibaba. This trend will likely play out in the UK and Canada as Boxing Day rolls around later this month.
Best practices for protecting eCommerce during the coronavirus pandemic
The bad guys are gearing up for these holidays. Not only have they had time to prepare and bring new tools to bear, but they know that consumers are overwhelmed and unfamiliar with the many new eCommerce services and apps. It’s up to us to make sure that they only get coal in their stockings this year: these best practices can help those in the retail eCommerce ecosystem, from SMBs and large retailers to card-issuing banks and credit payment fulfillment companies, prevent fraud and improve the customer experience:
- Never click on the links you receive in emails, as they could be phishing scams.
- Never visit dubious websites and do not download anything.
- Keep your mobile devices up to date with the latest software updates. Never download mobile shopping apps from unofficial or unauthorized sources.
- Don’t fall for SMS phishing attacks, in which hackers infiltrate mobile devices by using social engineering to pose as legitimate sources to get consumers to divulge personal information.
- Consumers should monitor their credit cards daily during the holiday season for suspicious and unauthorized charges.
- Consumers should pick one credit or debit card for their holiday shopping purchases to more easily manage and monitor transactions.
- Consumers need to regularly update their passwords. Do not use the same passwords repeatedly. Consumers should also consider using a password manager because they are easy to use and are safe.

Strengthening Cybersecurity Defense: An Insight into Modern Fraud Threat Detection Strategies | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/strengthening-cybersecurity-defense-an-insight-into-modern-fraud-threat-detection-strategies,2023-08-29,"Strengthening Cybersecurity Defense: An Insight into Modern Fraud Threat Detection Strategies
In today’s digital age, the battle against fraud threats is an ongoing challenge that requires constant innovation and vigilance. As technology advances, so do the methods employed by malicious actors to breach your fraud security defenses. To counter these threats, it’s crucial to deploy a multi-faceted approach that leverages a range of detection capabilities. In this article, we’ll explore several powerful techniques that Outseer FraudAction utilises to detect fraud threats, focusing on their benefits, use cases, and their role in fortifying fraud security measures.
1. Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Extracting Hidden Threats from Images and PDFs
Images and PDF files often contain valuable clues that can reveal potential fraud threats. By employing OCR capabilities, these seemingly innocent files can be analyzed to extract URLs and textual information that might be concealed. Using OCR allows FraudAction to unveil hidden links and data, providing a significant advantage in identifying malicious intent. This approach is especially effective against threats that attempt to mask themselves within visual content.
2. Known Domain/Subdomain Recognition: Swift Identification of Suspicious Web Addresses
Malicious actors often rely on seemingly legitimate domains or subdomains to trick users into interacting with their content. Leveraging the power of known domain and subdomain recognition, FraudAction can rapidly pinpoint potentially suspicious URLs. This capability ensures that you are promptly alerted to the presence of questionable addresses, bolstering protection against phishing attempts and fraudulent sites.
3. Known Attacks Filtering: Staying Ahead by Identifying Familiar Threats
In the ever-evolving landscape of fraud threats, some attacks have been encountered before. By filtering out known attack patterns, FraudAction can swiftly eliminate threats that have already been encountered and understood. This efficiency frees up resources for focusing on novel and emerging threats, allowing your team to maintain a proactive stance against fraudsters.
4. Brand Name Detection: Safeguarding Online Reputation with Targeted Keyword Analysis
Protecting your brand’s online presence is paramount in today’s interconnected world. By scanning source code for specific brand-related keywords, FraudAction can swiftly identify instances where your brand is being exploited for malicious purposes. This capability not only helps prevent potential reputational damage but also ensures that users are engaging with authentic content.
5. Page Title Recognition: Identifying Suspicious Content at a Glance
A web page’s title often holds valuable insights into its content and intent. By recognizing known page titles associated with fraud threats, FraudAction can quickly flag potentially harmful web pages. This approach is particularly effective in thwarting attacks that rely on the manipulation of user expectations through misleading titles.
6. Known Folder Paths Analysis: Detecting Attacks Along Familiar Trajectories

Synthetic Identity Theft: What It Is & How To Prevent It | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/synthetic-identity-theft,2021-12-28,"Synthetic Identity Theft: What It Is & How To Prevent It
Wondering about synthetic identity theft? We describe what it is, how it occurs, and the steps you can take to protect your organization.
What Is Synthetic Identity Theft?
Synthetic identity theft is a technique fraudsters use to gather a combination of real and fake information to create a new identity, which they then use to commit fraudulent transactions.
Fraudsters use stolen Social Security numbers and credit card numbers to define their identity and then mix in fake phone numbers, addresses, and other details to complete it. This technique makes it more difficult for merchants to detect and prevent these identities from making fraudulent transactions.
Fake Identity, Real Problem
While the term synthetic identity might sound like something from science fiction, it’s a very real problem. According to the FBI, synthetic identity fraud is one of the fastest-growing financial crimes in the United States. It’s estimated that synthetic identity theft costs financial institutions $20 billion in losses annually, according to the American Banking Association (ABA).
Unlike most online fraud, synthetic identity theft can be a slow process that’s tough to uncover. Criminals will slowly build up a reputable credit score over time, only to make a massive purchase or take out a large loan with no intention of paying it back.
For fraudsters, it’s never been easier to build a synthetic identity. The personal information of 281.5 million people has been compromised in data breaches in recent years, with new breaches up 17% in 2021. Databases containing stolen identity information are often dumped online freely, or sold on dark web marketplaces. Both small-time criminals and organized crime groups take advantage of this opportunity to defraud businesses and consumers.
How Are Synthetic Identities Created?
Criminals typically use stolen Social Security numbers or credit privacy numbers as a foundation for their synthetic identities. This information can be stolen via phishing scams or be part of a data dump on a dark web marketplace.
With this information in hand, fraudsters will typically make up the other details such as the address, email, and phone number. There are even online tools that can create and randomize these details.
In some cases, fraudsters will go as far as using the address of an abandoned house or linking the phone number to a prepaid cell phone number in order to complete two-factor authentication.
With the identity created, the fraudster enrolls the persona in several services to build credit. This could include registering for a credit card, putting bills on autopay, or continuously paying back small loans over time.
Sometimes, it’s established through something called “piggybacking.” This entails paying someone with a good credit score to let the fake identity become an authorized user of their credit card account, boosting the identity’s credit score. Other times, it’s just by applying for a loan. Even if declined, it automatically creates a credit profile.
With a larger credit limit, criminals stand to make a lot more when they choose to drain a credit line or get approved for a large purchase. In some cases, synthetic identities are used to launder money. For example, criminals can use synthetic identities to bypass know your customer (KYC) requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges and investment accounts.
How Does Synthetic Identity Theft Work?
Cultivating ersatz identities takes a lot of time, patience, and attention to detail. When a synthetic identity has “matured,” the game plan typically involves acquiring multiple lines of credit and then suddenly maxing them out on major shopping sprees before disappearing into thin air in “cash out” or “bust out” schemes.
The payout can be huge. The ABA estimates the average synthetic identity profile is used to successfully steal between $81,000 and $97,000. In one instance, a fraudster using synthetic identities obtained 558 credit cards in order to purchase a small fleet of luxury sedans. Another allegedly leveraged synthetic identities to take out $3.4 million in credit cards used to purchase prepaid cash cards, which are nearly impossible to trace.
Organized crime groups are also known to use synthetic identities to launder money and avoid taxes on gains. By using a synthetic identity, criminals can purchase cryptocurrency to fund other activities while avoiding taxes. With most cryptocurrencies being decentralized, it’s extremely difficult to ever recover the funds or identify the real fraudster.
Synthetic identity fraud impacts a lot of different people, making it a particularly malicious form of financial crime. Banks, creditors, and cryptocurrency exchanges that aren’t using adequate fraud detection are often blindsided. Since synthetic identities build a legitimate credit score and reputation over time, they can be tough to root out once established.
If authorities open a fraud investigation, many times all evidence points back to the victim of the stolen SSN. All too often, that victim is a child under the age of 18. Their SSNs are prized by cyberthieves precisely because they’re years away from discovering the crimes perpetrated using one of their key pieces of identity information.
With the details covered, let’s explore how both businesses and consumers can protect themselves and prevent synthetic identity fraud.
How to Prevent Synthetic Identity Theft
To prevent synthetic identity theft fraud, businesses should do the following:
- Use machine learning fraud detection and prevention.
- Verify each piece of new customer information during account registration.
- Automatically monitor all transactions for signs of fraud.
- Keep up to date with identity screening best practices.
- Use anti-fraud systems that leverage global data-sharing networks.
- Apply extra scrutiny to account applicants using CPNs rather than an EIN or SSN.
To prevent synthetic identity theft consumers should do the following:
- Monitor credit for any fraudulent purchases, new enrollments, or surprise loans.
- Avoid using SSNs when possible.
- Freeze your own and your children’s credit to help avoid identity theft.
- Consider using an identity theft monitoring service.
Check mail for any suspicious enrollment letters or government letters.

Examining the Consequences of Telegram’s Privacy Changes and Their Effect on Fraudster Activity
Cybercriminals have long used social media platforms to communicate, trade stolen data, and share compromised credentials. One of the most popular platforms for this activity has been the messaging app Telegram. However, a significant shift is underway following recent events involving Telegram’s leadership and changes to its privacy policy.
On August 24, 2024, Telegram’s CEO, Pavel Durov, was arrested outside of Paris. This arrest has started to influence the behavior of cybercriminals who rely on the platform, as noted by FraudAction’s intelligence researchers. In a subsequent development on September 23, 2024, Durov announced a major update to Telegram’s privacy policy, which is set to alter how the platform handles criminal activity.

Key Changes in Telegram’s Privacy Policy
The new policy mandates that Telegram will now share user data with authorities in response to valid legal requests. Specifically, this includes the IP addresses and phone numbers of users suspected of criminal activity or violations of Telegram’s terms of service. The move is aimed at curbing the use of the platform for illegal purposes, including fraud and cybercrime.
With over 900 million active users, Telegram has been a popular hub for cybercriminals to trade stolen databases, user credentials, credit card information, and more. Fraudsters also use the platform to communicate with others, exchange hacking techniques, and sell illicit goods. This policy change, however, introduces a significant risk to those engaged in these activities.
Fraudsters on the Move: The Shift to Signal
In response to the new privacy measures, FraudAction researchers have observed a growing number of cybercriminals migrating from Telegram to more secure messaging platforms like Signal. Founded by Moxie Marlinspike, Signal has emerged as a favored alternative due to its strong privacy features, including end-to-end encryption and minimal data collection. Unlike Telegram, Signal does not store metadata such as phone numbers or IP addresses, and its disappearing messages feature offers additional anonymity.
This mass migration is largely driven by Telegram’s new willingness to comply with legal authorities, which increases the risk of exposure for fraudsters and cybercriminals. Many have announced their intention to leave Telegram in favor of Signal, which they perceive as a safer option to continue their illicit activities.

The CNP Fraud Imperative | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/the-cnp-fraud-imperative,2021-03-20,"The CNP Fraud Imperative
In a post-pandemic world, Card-Not-Present (CNP) fraud is skyrocketing. Here’s how to stop it.
The CNP Fraud Imperative
The past year has been quite a decade: the pandemic dramatically accelerated digital shopping trends and put digital transformation front and center for financial institutions, credit card companies, and customers walloped by Card-Not-Present (CNP) fraud.
Look at how far we’ve come – and how quickly these changes have taken effect: more than half of all people who’ve ever purchased groceries online have done so since shelter-in-place mandates were first enacted due to the COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020. Ditto for nearly 1 in 4 people who’ve ever purchased digital entertainment through mobile or online channels. And retail merchants with buy-online-pickup-in-store (BOPIS) prior to the pandemic have seen transactions in this channel jump 70% by volume and 58% by value.
With consumers now firmly accustomed to this level of convenience, payments transformation is at the top of the agenda. Whether it’s online shopping, credit card-connected loyalty and payment apps, or newfangled voice commerce, innovation is the name of the game in 2021.
Unfortunately for us all, fraudsters got the memo.
CNP Fraud: The $130 Billion Problem
Digital CNP transactions have boomed since the beginning of the pandemic, and so has CNP fraud.
Accounting for $2.8 billion in losses back in 2014, illegal transactions made using stolen credit card information ballooned to $5.5 billion in 2018, and is estimated to have topped $6.4 billion in 2020. Aite Group projects a 16.4% increase in CNP fraud this year.
That may just be the tip of the iceberg. Juniper Research estimates that by 2023, retailers are set to lose more than $78 billion through this form of fraud worldwide—$130 billion over the preceding five years. As a result, the success of BOPIS and other popular trends and promising new innovations will depend on preventing CNP fraud.
As it stands now, BOPIS is seeing a 7% fraud attempt rate compared to 4.6% with other delivery channels, driven mostly by fraudsters taking advantage of the short window between purchase and pickup, according to Payments Journal. It is, after all, an easy way to bypass EMV chip, PIN, or signature verification.
Transformation Initiatives at Risk
Post-pandemic ecommerce is ripe for digital innovation. The kind that’s years in the making, but will still seem to suddenly appear as if from nowhere. Banks, credit card companies, and others will be ready for transformative change—or else.
For starters, digital commerce seasonality has finally smoothed. What was once a lead-up to the all-important fourth quarter is now a year-long, steady-state affair. Even demographic cohorts that long grumbled, “I don’t do online shopping” now fire up mobile transactions with seeming abandon.
Contactless payments of all kinds are proliferating. Over the next year, look for voice commerce to start to gain traction as more consumers discover the joy of saying, “Alexa, Mama needs a new pair of shoes.” Not just via smart home devices, mind you. Also by mobile phone and automobile dashboards, too.
Beyond BOPIS, shopping IRL is about to undergo other significant changes.
As the world reopens, card issuers and acquirers alike must prepare for a new wave of “scan-and-go” transactions powered directly by or through apps tied to them. Shoppers walk in, scan the items they want with their mobile phone, and simply walk out the door with their goods—facilitating a transaction in real-time, on the fly—no EMV chip-enabled credit card (or standing in line) required.
Truth & Friction: The Rise of Risk-Based Authentication
As organizations accelerate these and other kinds of digital transformation initiatives, they must also prepare to manage the risks that come with them. But today, financial services organizations, credit card companies and others are layering in new defenses against CNP fraud with varying success.
Just one case in point: Confirming each CNP transaction with the customer via text message has been a growing trend, especially when the amount being transacted is unusually high. This practice, however, can create friction that can lead want-it-now consumers to abandon the purchase, never to return. In March 2020, 88% of online shopping orders were abandoned, according to Statistica. It’s unlikely that those rates have fallen since then.
Risk-based and adaptive authentication payments strategies are now table stakes. Solutions that build upon the features available in the 3D-Secure v2.2 protocol, for instance, analyze hundreds of different risk indicators to silently authenticate cardholders before the transaction even happens. In real-world deployments, merchants are delivering a frictionless transaction experience while challenging only the small minority of high-risk transactions.
I’m biased, of course, since these technologies are at the heart of Outseer solutions. But given the opportunities and risks ahead, CNP fraud prevention may be just a necessity to current transformation initiatives. It very well may be the killer app.

The Growing Threat of Android Banking Trojans: Protecting Users and Organizations | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/the-growing-threat-of-android-banking-trojans-protecting-users-and-organizations,2023-07-10,"The Growing Threat of Android Banking Trojans: Protecting Users and Organizations
In recent times, the rise of Android Banking Trojans has become a cause for concern in the realm of cybersecurity. Threat actors have recognized the lucrative potential of these Trojans and have begun developing and selling customized overlay injections, targeting not only traditional financial institutions but also various other sectors such as cryptowallets, streaming platforms, delivery services, retail stores, and more. This blog delves into the dangers posed by Android Banking Trojans and emphasizes the importance of combating them by terminating their Command & Control (C&C) servers.
The Significance of Command & Control Servers
C&C servers act as the central control hub for Android Banking Trojans, allowing the attackers to remotely manage and control the infected devices. These servers serve as the brains behind the malware, enabling threat actors to execute malicious activities. Some C&C panels may adopt deceptive tactics, such as presenting innocuous blank pages or fake 404 errors, while others employ warnings like “Your connection is not secure.” In certain cases, fraudsters design login panels specifically crafted to facilitate interaction with compromised devices.
Top Three Most Active Android Banking Trojans
- Hydra (formerly known as BianLian): Hydra has emerged as the most widespread Android Banking Trojan in recent months. It offers similar functionalities to other dangerous banking Trojans, but what sets it apart is its continually evolving cookie-stealing feature and its ability to target specific brands. Hydra is offered as Malware as a Service (MaaS) and has dominated the Android Banking Trojan landscape in terms of the number of observed online C&C servers.
- Octo (also known as Coper or ExobotCompact): Octo is a formidable Android Banking Trojan that has gained notoriety within the cybercrime landscape. Like other advanced banking Trojans, Octo is offered as MaaS in underground forums. It possesses anti-analysis techniques and can capture data from other installed apps visible on the infected device’s screen.
- Alien: Alien is a mobile banking Trojan that operates as Malware as a Service (MaaS). It is believed to have derived from the well-known Cerberus banking Android Banking Trojan, which was highly active between 2019 and 2020.
Targeted Apps by Trojan Type and Country
Android Banking Trojans have emerged as a significant threat, impacting a wide range of applications, industries, and regions. Among the top three countries with the highest app injections offered are the United States, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the United Kingdom (UK).
In addition to the specific countries, certain regions have become hotspots for Android Banking Trojan activities. The top three regions with the highest app injections offered include the European Union (EU), the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, and the UAE.
When it comes to industries, the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector bears the brunt of Android Banking Trojans, accounting for a staggering 76% of the total share. This industry is an attractive target due to its wealth of sensitive financial information and the potential for significant financial gains for threat actors. As the backbone of the global economy, the BFSI sector faces constant challenges in securing its mobile banking infrastructure and safeguarding customer data.
The prominence of the BFSI industry in mobile banking Trojan attacks underscores the need for enhanced security measures and proactive defence strategies. Financial institutions, banks, and insurance companies must prioritize investments in robust fraud prevention solutions and adopt a multi-layered approach to protect their customers and assets. This includes implementing stringent authentication mechanisms, continuously monitoring for unusual activities, and educating users about potential risks and best practices.
However, it is important to note that Android Banking Trojans do not discriminate when it comes to their potential targets. While the BFSI industry may be the primary focus, other sectors, such as healthcare, e-commerce, and entertainment, also face risks. Threat actors have expanded their scope and are increasingly targeting non-traditional banking companies, including streaming platforms, delivery services, retail stores, and gasoline apps. This wide array of targeted industries highlights the versatility and adaptability of Android Banking Trojans.
Combating Android Banking Trojans: The Role of C&C Server Takedowns
The hunt for C&C servers plays a critical role in combating the threat Android Banking Trojans pose. Detecting and dismantling these malicious servers is crucial to minimizing and preventing the damage caused by Trojans, safeguarding both individual users and organizations.
The increasing prevalence of Android Banking Trojans and the sale of customized overlay injections highlight the pressing need for robust cybersecurity measures. As threat actors continue to evolve their tactics and target various sectors, it becomes essential for users and organizations to remain vigilant and take proactive steps to protect themselves. By focusing on identifying and eliminating Command & Control servers, we can significantly mitigate the damage caused by these Trojans and ensure a safer digital landscape for everyone involved.

In addition to the specific countries, certain regions have become hotspots for Android Banking Trojan activities. The top three regions with the highest app injections offered include the European Union (EU), the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, and the UAE.
When it comes to industries, the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector bears the brunt of Android Banking Trojans, accounting for a staggering 76% of the total share. This industry is an attractive target due to its wealth of sensitive financial information and the potential for significant financial gains for threat actors. As the backbone of the global economy, the BFSI sector faces constant challenges in securing its mobile banking infrastructure and safeguarding customer data.
The prominence of the BFSI industry in mobile banking Trojan attacks underscores the need for enhanced security measures and proactive defence strategies. Financial institutions, banks, and insurance companies must prioritize investments in robust fraud prevention solutions and adopt a multi-layered approach to protect their customers and assets. This includes implementing stringent authentication mechanisms, continuously monitoring for unusual activities, and educating users about potential risks and best practices.
However, it is important to note that Android Banking Trojans do not discriminate when it comes to their potential targets. While the BFSI industry may be the primary focus, other sectors, such as healthcare, e-commerce, and entertainment, also face risks. Threat actors have expanded their scope and are increasingly targeting non-traditional banking companies, including streaming platforms, delivery services, retail stores, and gasoline apps. This wide array of targeted industries highlights the versatility and adaptability of Android Banking Trojans.
Combating Android Banking Trojans: The Role of C&C Server Takedowns
The hunt for C&C servers plays a critical role in combating the threat Android Banking Trojans pose. Detecting and dismantling these malicious servers is crucial to minimizing and preventing the damage caused by Trojans, safeguarding both individual users and organizations.
The increasing prevalence of Android Banking Trojans and the sale of customized overlay injections highlight the pressing need for robust cybersecurity measures. As threat actors continue to evolve their tactics and target various sectors, it becomes essential for users and organizations to remain vigilant and take proactive steps to protect themselves. By focusing on identifying and eliminating Command & Control servers, we can significantly mitigate the damage caused by these Trojans and ensure a safer digital landscape for everyone involved.

The Metaverse: Fraud’s Next Frontier? | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/the-metaverse-fraud,2022-08-02,"The Metaverse: Fraud’s Next Frontier?
In the metaverse, brands and their customers could get bludgeoned by ever-more sophisticated and costly attacks. Cybercriminal efforts to harvest account logins and payment information in the metaverse signal that we should all brace for a rise in phishing attacks, either through typical channels like email or through metaversal impersonation.
VR, NFTs, and DeFi may get all the press, but for brands diving headfirst into the metaverse, the operative acronym is more visceral: FOMO. They may also want to reacquaint themselves with a different f-word—fraud.
Admittedly, the marketing hype is hard to resist. Epic Games, Match.com, Burberry, Warner Bros., and other major brands are unveiling hip, new metaversal products, services, and experiences that gain instant buzz. Gucci’s $4,100 virtual handbag? Solid gold. Nike’s $130,000 CryptoKicks? High-key awesome. Million-dollar virtual homes in Decentraland? Hot damn.
At once heralded as “the future of the Internet,” some kind of VR-infused social platform, or maybe a video game, the metaverse is anything but new. The concept was first popularized by Neal Stephenson’s sci-fi novel “Snow Crash” three decades ago. And there have been countless high-profile incarnations with names like Second Life and (more recently) Fortnite. But the floodgate of industry enthusiasm has only been growing since Facebook-turned-Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg first unleashed his vision last July.
It’s not entirely without warrant, either, because the “killer app” of the metaverse is blockchain and the realization of a distributed web—or Web3. Where once you might have hit a rave, built a home, or done business in a somewhat-limited virtual world, you can now create and monetize virtual worlds of your own. You can even sell digital goods—fashion, home furnishings, luxury cars, you name it—that transcend different metaverses and, in some instances, the physical world. As consumers shop, collaborate, bank, and play in the metaverse, fraudsters are sure to follow—harming consumers and causing reputational damage along the way.
“As consumers shop, collaborate, bank, and play in the metaverse, fraudsters are sure to follow—harming consumers and causing reputational damage along the way.”
Heavens to Zuck Bucks: There’s Big Money in the Metaverse.
Never mind that only 31% of US adults have any clue what the metaverse even is—they’re already buying into what JPMorgan Chase says could soon be a $1 trillion annual gold mine. According to Statista, three-quarters of American adults either already have some kind of avatar in a metaverse or are considering experiencing a facet of their lives in virtual environments soon. That makes it a must for any retail or entertainment brand’s omnichannel strategies.
Just as IRL, transactions can be conducted in several different ways. Today, the most common form of payment is through digital currencies. That can mean borderless options like Bitcoin, Mana, non-fungible tokens (those NFTs), or exchangeable metaverse-specific currencies. Think Fortnite’s V-Bucks or Meta’s proposed currency, sometimes humorously referred to as “Zuck Bucks.” Distributed finance (DeFi) means cryptocurrency payments are nearly instantaneous, so there’s no need to wait for funds to be transferred between banks.
As Digital Journal points out, this also offers a level of privacy not typically found in traditional payment methods. Merchants may also allow credit card transactions, which could boost sales by giving customers not yet comfortable with all things crypto a quick, familiar way to meta-transact.
If these digital purchases are both fast and convenient, you could be talking some serious bank, but it also opens up everybody to some new (and some OG) forms of fraud.
Payments Paradise–or Road to Perdition?
Like the primordial Web 1.0 of the 1990s, the emerging metaverse is a new kind of Wild West. All those digital payment options can grease the wheels of commerce, but they’re also dinner bell for cybercriminals.
Digital identities can be tough to verify when users may have multiple avatars originating on different platforms. The use of synthetic identity fraud for account enrollment is already a $6 billion a year problem. But what happens when there are fictitious identities behind numerous avatars spanning countless metaverses?
For merchants allowing card-not-present transactions, CNP fraud is likely to figure prominently, samesies for chargeback fraud. But that’s not the real danger. The fact is, cryptocurrencies offer a nearly untraceable avenue for monetizing stolen credit card numbers and laundering pilfered funds—making payment fraud all the more convenient and risk-free (for meta-thieves, that is). Popular buy now, pay later (BNPL) options are likely to see trouble, too.
Meanwhile, the blockchain itself may be secure, but account takeover (ATO, also referred to as “authority to operate” in Web3-speak) attacks on digital wallets or virtual world user accounts can also have devastating consequences. Losses from ATOs, metaversal and otherwise, exceeded $12 billion in 2021—up from $4 billion in 2018. And from 2020 and 2021, cryptocurrency theft topped $3.2 billion, a 516% increase in just 12 months.
Cybercriminal efforts to harvest account logins and payment information in the metaverse signal that we should all brace for a rise in phishing attacks, either through typical channels like email or through metaversal impersonation. “Is that virtual Wal-Mart legit?”, “That Bank of America branch?”, “Is that really your CEO requesting sensitive employee information during a virtual meeting?” for that matter, is this even the company’s virtual meeting space or a malicious knock-off designed to launch malware or steal sensitive information?
In the metaverse, brands and their customers could get bludgeoned by ever-more sophisticated and costly attacks. But it doesn’t have to be this way.
Preventing the Metaverse of Madness
A layered approach to fraud prevention will be required to protect brands and their customers from cybercriminals within the metaverse. Some of this will need to be implemented by each metaverse’s operator; the rest may fall on the brands themselves.
A risk-based approach that transparently authenticates users behind the scenes is needed to detect and prevent fraudulent behavior and transactions while maintaining the ease and convenience critical to the success of the metaverse. A sturdy offense against brand impersonation scams is no longer optional when the range of scams expand from phishing texts and emails. Say hello to bogus social media pages, phony mobile apps, and countless new modes of communication emerging from the metaverse.
But not just any technology will do. Any effective solution must leverage modern machine learning, advanced data science, and globally-shared transaction and identity data spanning the digital and physical worlds. Cyberattack takedown services will be required to identify fraudulent impersonations behind phishing attacks and other forms of brand abuse.
Only using Outseer as an example:
- Our payment fraud and account monitoring solutions prevent 95% of all fraud loss, with a customer intervention rate of just 5%—the best performance in the industry.
- With the rapidly growing constellation of commerce models and digital channels, our emerging payments platform continuously expands to safeguard the digital economy wherever businesses and their customers transact.
- Our comprehensive, 24/7 cyberattack detection and takedown services close down scams and attacks before they can cause severe financial and reputational harm.

The Threat of Ransomware Groups | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/the-threat-of-ransomware-groups,2024-10-31,"The Threat of Ransomware Groups
In today’s ever-changing cyber threat landscape, ransomware groups are responsible for some of the most sophisticated and dangerous attacks on large organizations worldwide. Whether driven by financial gain or political motives (hacktivism), these gangs operate globally and often extort significant sums from their victims. They infiltrate systems, encrypt sensitive data, and demand ransom in exchange for a decryption key. If the ransom is unpaid, they threaten to release the stolen data publicly.
Among these groups, Lockbit has emerged as the most prominent, responsible for nearly 2,000 attacks since its formation in 2019.
Lockbit Overview
Lockbit, also known as “ABCD Ransomware,” is currently one of the most prolific ransomware groups. First observed in September 2019, it is known for blocking user access to systems and demanding ransom payments. Lockbit’s attacks span various platforms, including Windows and Linux, with victims across the U.S., Europe, India, China, and Indonesia. Interestingly, the group avoids Russian targets, suggesting possible political motives.
For example, recent attacks targeted the UK’s Royal Mail, the City of Oakland, and automotive retailer Pendragon PLC. Additionally, Lockbit’s ransomware-as-a-service is highly adaptable, capable of double extortion by not only encrypting data but also threatening to publicly release it if ransoms are unpaid.
Lockbit uses a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, selling its software to other criminals who share the ransom proceeds. Their attacks are typically delivered through social engineering, spear-phishing, or brute-force attacks. Once inside a system, Lockbit autonomously escalates privileges and encrypts files, leaving ransom notes in every folder. Ransom demands range from $100,000 to $10 million.
Despite claiming to operate from various locations, many cybersecurity experts believe Lockbit is Russia-based, as its members are primarily Russian speakers and avoid targeting Russian entities. Lockbit has continuously evolved, with versions 2.0 (Lockbit Red) and 3.0 (Lockbit Black) emerging in 2021 and 2022 to enhance its capabilities and evade detection.
Operation Cronos
Lockbit leak website seized by the authorities
In February 2024, after years of activity, authorities launched Operation Cronos to dismantle Lockbit. On February 19th, law enforcement agencies from the U.S., UK, and EU seized Lockbit’s leak website on the dark web, taking down 34 servers hosting stolen data, decryption keys, and crypto addresses. Two individuals linked to the group were arrested in Poland and Ukraine, and over 200 cryptocurrency wallets were confiscated.
On May 2, 2024, the National Crime Agency (NCA), FBI, and Europol repurposed a seized Lockbit website to disclose insights from the operation, including a list of affiliates and details on Lockbit’s deceptive practices, such as failing to delete stolen data even after ransom payments.
Lockbit’s New Leak Platform
Despite these actions, Lockbit resurfaced quickly. On May 6, 2024, a new Lockbit data leak website appeared on the dark web, accessible only via decryption keys sold by Lockbit for $300.

Links to this site and access keys have been shared on underground forums and social media.

In September 2024, Lockbit also launched a new Telegram channel, where it regularly posts lists of victims and screenshots of stolen data.
Screenshot of Lockbit 3.0 official Telegram channel
In recent months, Lockbit 3.0 has intensified its global attacks. Despite ongoing law enforcement efforts, the group’s swift return and enhanced security measures suggest that the dismantled infrastructure was only a small part of their operation, and they likely have multiple backups to evade further sanctions.
Lockbit 3.0 continues to operate globally, suggesting the infrastructure taken down by authorities was only part of a larger network. Despite ongoing efforts by law enforcement, Lockbit’s swift resurgence and enhanced security measures imply that it holds multiple backups to counter future actions.
Ongoing Threat and Best Practices for Mitigating Ransomware Attacks
In just five years, Lockbit has solidified its position as a major cybercrime threat. Despite extensive efforts by global law enforcement, it remains active and carrying out ransomware attacks globally. To prevent ransomware attacks, organizations should subscribe to a cyber intelligence service such as Outseer’s FraudAction Tier 3 cyber intelligence to stay on top of emerging ransomware group, keep systems updated with security patches, update IT policies as needed and maintain offline backups of critical data. In case of infection, immediately disconnect the affected device from the network to prevent further spread.

Despite ongoing law enforcement efforts, the group’s swift return and enhanced security measures suggest that the dismantled infrastructure was only a small part of their operation, and they likely have multiple backups to evade further sanctions.
Lockbit 3.0 continues to operate globally, suggesting the infrastructure taken down by authorities was only part of a larger network. Despite ongoing efforts by law enforcement, Lockbit’s swift resurgence and enhanced security measures imply that it holds multiple backups to counter future actions.
Ongoing Threat and Best Practices for Mitigating Ransomware Attacks
In just five years, Lockbit has solidified its position as a major cybercrime threat. Despite extensive efforts by global law enforcement, it remains active and carrying out ransomware attacks globally. To prevent ransomware attacks, organizations should subscribe to a cyber intelligence service such as Outseer’s FraudAction Tier 3 cyber intelligence to stay on top of emerging ransomware group, keep systems updated with security patches, update IT policies as needed and maintain offline backups of critical data. In case of infection, immediately disconnect the affected device from the network to prevent further spread.

Transaction Fraud | How to Protect Your Business & Customers
We explain what transaction fraud is, common schemes that fraudsters use, and how to protect your customers and the consumers and businesses they serve.
What Is Transaction Fraud?
Transaction fraud is the use of stolen or counterfeit information obtained by bad actors in order to make transactions illegally. Some common types of transaction fraud include the following:
· Card-Not-Present (CNP) Fraud
· Chargeback/Friendly Fraud
· Account Takeover
Transaction fraud losses to issuers, merchants, and acquirers alone exceeded $28 billion in 2020, a figure that could top $35 billion by 2025. And that’s before all the additional expenses incurred from operations, call centers, and the investigation of fraudulent transactions.
With more businesses online than ever before, issuers, payment processors and others stand to lose more than just revenue. Negative customer experiences through brand impersonation, phishing attacks, or even increased transaction friction caused by traditional anti-fraud measures can cause reputational damage.
With so many angles of attack, let’s review a few of the most common types of transaction fraud and what you can do today to prevent them.
Types of Transaction Fraud
Card Not Present (CNP) Fraud
CNP fraud occurs when fraudsters steal cardholder data and attempt to make a transaction without physically possessing the card. Data theft in CNP scams is primarily carried out through online phishing techniques. Scammers impersonate brands online and capture a victim’s card information in the process. This information is used elsewhere for a fraudulent transaction.
Far tougher: So-called “clean fraud” attacks, in which fraudsters have collected enough personally identifiable information that they’re better able to impersonate their victims—going so far as to make purchases from the same merchants used by the legitimate cardholder. Not only does this increase the chances of evading fraud detection systems, but it may not even be discovered by the cardholder for months.
CNP scams can be third to stop, but, with advancements in machine learning, it’s possible to protect cardholders and merchants from even the most sophisticated forms of attack.
You can prevent CNP fraud by doing the following:
- Verifying the address of the cardholder and the payer
- Checking the validity of the CVV security code on credit card transactions
- Leveraging the latest EMV® 3-D Secure standard for online transactions
Outseer 3-D Secure uses risk-based analysis (RBA) to reduce fraud and chargebacks stemming from online transactions. By working to authenticate customers transparently behind the scenes, this frictionless approach reduces false positives and increases transaction approvals for legitimate purchases—without slowing down your customer.
And because it leverages transaction and identity data from a global network of partners, Outseer 3-D Secure is even able to recognize fraudulent purchases made with merchants used by the authentic cardholder—stopping “clean fraud” in its tracks.
Chargebacks, or ‘Friendly Fraud’
Don’t be fooled by the name: There’s nothing friendly about friendly fraud. This form of chargeback fraud occurs when a customer deliberately issues a chargeback on a good or service they have already received. The criminal states that their credit card number was stolen, and they are reimbursed while they keep the product.
In some instances, this can be done accidentally, like when a child orders something on their parent’s card without the parent’s knowledge. A consumer may also review their credit card statement and not recognize the charge or the associated vendor and initiate a chargeback. In either case, businesses can use different technologies to identify and prevent these issues.
You can prevent friendly fraud by taking the following precautions:
Using easy to recognize transaction descriptors in credit card statements
Implementing a no-tolerance policy that results in a cancelled card for false chargebacks
Leveraging machine learning to block abusive customers
Outseer 3-D Secure’s frictionless flow simultaneously minimizes chargeback losses from fraud while reducing cart abandonment and boosting transaction approval rates.
Account Takeover
Account Takeover (ATO) occurs when a threat actor accesses a legitimate customer account. Cybercriminals use phishing techniques and shop the dark web to acquire customer login credentials. Criminals can use that information to commit direct transaction fraud or to pilfer other personal information they can leverage in other crimes.
In the US, account takeovers accounted for more than $16 billion in loss last year—up 300% from 2019. But Card issuers, banks, and other payment processors can help prevent account takeover fraud with the following techniques:
- Checking data dumps for compromised accounts and forcing password changes
- Using geolocation and behavioral data to detect suspicious logins
- Requiring alternate forms of authentication such as 2FA
Outseer Fraud Manager leverages identity science and shared data from 20 billion annual transactions spanning every industry and geography to measure the risk associated with a user’s login and post-login activities—including transactions, changes to account details, and other data that may reveal a cybercriminal takeover. All while delivering a seamless user experience for legitimate customers—no 2FA required.
Meanwhile, Outseer FraudAction rounds out your defenses by giving you unprecedented visibility on compromised credit card numbers, login credentials and more, so you can take protective measures before it becomes a serious issue.

Transaction Monitoring: What It Is & How It’s Done | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/transaction-monitoring,2021-12-03,"Transaction Monitoring: What It Is & How It’s Done
Wondering about transaction monitoring? We explain what it is, how it’s done, and how it helps protect merchants and customers from fraudulent transactions.
What Is Transaction Monitoring?
Transaction monitoring refers to card issuers and financial institutions monitoring the transactions customers make in real time and analyzing these transactions for suspicious activity based on the customer’s account information and history.
By monitoring transactions, banks, credit card companies, and others can detect and prevent fraud, comply with anti-money laundering regulations, and block account takeover attempts. Yet despite the efforts, transaction fraud has only increased in recent years.
In 2021, transaction fraud soared to new heights while taking on new contours. Thanks to the pandemic-fueled spike in online and mobile transactions, card-not-present fraud alone topped $7.9 billion in 2021, and is expected to exceed $17.2 billion in annual loss within the next two years.
Unfortunately, that’s also just for starters. Armed with stolen login, payment, and other personal data, fraudsters are quickly evolving their approaches to exploit evolving payment platforms and channels. According to our own data, 70% of all transaction fraud in digital banking is now made through mobile devices, with the biggest rise seen in mobile app fraud, for instance. The price tag for all forms of transaction fraud across ecommerce, banking, and other sectors could be as high as $1 trillion per year.
Thanks to advancements in risk-based fraud detection however, transaction monitoring is now a viable option for protecting cardholders, businesses, and other transacting parties. Before we dive into transaction monitoring strategies, let’s first explore how transaction monitoring works.
How Does Transaction Monitoring Work?
Early Transaction Monitoring Systems
In the early days of transaction monitoring, companies relied on a series of predefined rules and characteristics to identify and stop fraud. Anti-fraud systems would analyze a transaction to see if it matched a list of known fraudulent transactions.
Fraudsters quickly realized they could introduce randomness or change attack vectors to circumvent detection. But throttling up defenses has introduced other challenges. With more traditional transaction monitoring solutions, 52% of transactions flagged as fraud are false declines. Over time, these antiquated systems have given way to a more sophisticated and modern form of transaction monitoring.
Transaction Monitoring Today
Modern, risk-based transaction monitoring systems combine data science and machine learning to automatically identify fraud and apply the appropriate countermeasures.
Risk-based monitoring compares each transaction to statistical models and assigns the transaction a risk score based on the behavior of the user. Rather than looking for specific actions, machine learning algorithms detect fraud based on analysis of a broad spectrum of inputs.
Through machine learning, these systems can study hundreds of data points to assess the risk of a transaction in only a few seconds. Among many others, data such as device ID, login location, session behaviors, and IP address are analyzed to determine the likelihood a transaction attempt is fraudulent.
Some examples of suspicious activity may include the following:
- Known user logging in from a new device
- Known user logging in from a new location
- Unusually large purchases
- Numerous duplicate transactions in a short period of time
- The cardholder address does not match the mailing address
Statistical analysis is used to assign a risk score to each transaction This process assigns each transaction a risk score based on the probability of it being fraudulent. Organizations can customize different thresholds, alerts, and step-up verifications, depending on the level of risk.
This allows companies to do business in a way that protects cardholders and other end users in accordance with the organization’s business objectives and risk management strategies.
Transactions with low-risk scores are allowed to be placed without any delay or intervention. Suspicious traffic diverts to a challenge flow where users are prompted for additional identity verification. This protects legitimate users from unnecessary friction while shopping or using a brand’s platform.
Challenge flows require some form of secondary identification to authenticate the user. Typically this is done via an email or text confirmation but could include voice ID, a fingerprint scan, or other forms of biometric authentication.
If the user completes the challenge flow, they are redirected back to checkout to complete the transaction. Organizations can configure different flows for transactions that reach certain risk thresholds and customize their fraud prevention system to suit their risk tolerance and company policies.
Transaction Monitoring Best Practices
Starting with a strong foundation of best practices is the best way to mitigate risk from fraud and prevent transaction fraud before it impacts your customers, cardholders, and your bottom line.
Leverage Firewall Rules
Firewall rules can make it easy to comply with sanctions and avoid fraudulent transactions by blocking high-risk countries. If you notice cases of fraud originating from a particular geolocation, IP address, or domain, you can block these transactions in nearly all business-grade firewalls. This process can be done manually as you identify suspicious activity or proactively. For example, if you don’t offer your products to specific countries you can add them to the block list ahead of time.
Take Advantage of Machine Learning Platforms
Machine learning and artificial intelligence have proven to be the most effective tools for combating transaction fraud. These platforms are designed to scale with your business and continuously monitor the threat landscape to block new and evolving attacks. While manual fraud investigation can certainly be effective, AI-powered systems work around the clock with little to no human intervention needed.
Prioritize Frictionless Flow
Transaction monitoring doesn’t have to negatively affect the transaction experience or result in false declines. When sourcing transaction monitoring providers, verify they offer challenge flows that include frictionless flow. Frictionless flow prioritizes the customer experience by reserving out-of-band authentication for only the very small number of transactions that are truly high risk.

UK Finance 2024 APP Scam Statistics Shows Changing Scammer Tactics and the Need for Telcos and Digital Platforms to Join the Fight
In late May 2025, UK Finance produced its annual report on unauthorized and authorized fraud in the UK for the year 2024. This blog will focus on the authorized transaction activity, known as Authorized Push Payments (APP). The one caveat to the UK Finance data is that it only comes from the 33 contributing members of UK Finance; however, this this includes all of the large banks. This makes it difficult to compare the data to say Australia’s recent scam loss data for 2024, where the scam data comes from Australian government sources. Plus, most of the UK Finance data is from Faster Payments, which is where most of the scams occur in the UK.
As a result, it will be hard to say if one country is doing better than another. What we can clearly say is that the effort in the UK, with strong bank scam controls and money mule controls, along with consumer reimbursement up to £85,000, is working to contain consumer scams. As we will see later, the APP scam numbers did not drop very much, as I had hoped for in 2024.
Assessment of the Results
APP scam fraud, as reported by UK Finance shows losses flattening out (only down 2%) from 2023 to 2024. Table 1 shows the scam details from 2020–2024. In reviewing these statistics, remember that mandatory scam reimbursement began October 7, 2024. So, for the final three months of 2024, the reimbursement should have been at about 90% of the scam losses. Yet, these statistics show that although scam losses went from £459.7 million in 2023 down to £450.7 million in 2024, reimbursement dropped from £287.3 million in 2023 to £267.1 million in 2024, whereas reimbursement should have risen with the new mandate.
The reimbursement rate in 2024, including the three months under mandatory reimbursement, was 59.2%. The reimbursement rate in 2023, with only voluntary reimbursement from the large UK banks, was higher at 62%. When we look at the May 2025 report from the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), they only showed reimbursement of £27 million for the first three months of the reimbursement program (October 7 2024–January 7 2025) at an 86% reimbursement rate for this period. For a three month period, this should have probably been a higher amount of reimbursement, given the UK Finance 2024 APP scam loss number of £450.7 for all of 2024. The PSR report did not include the total scam losses for this 3 month period.
The PSR did report that the volume of APP claims during that 3 month period were lower than expected, providing early feedback that there was not a rush of first party fraud.
I would have expected the total value of gross scam losses to have been materially lower in 2024, given all of the scam controls and money mule controls required of payment service providers. As an offset, we know the scammers are using GenAI to create better impersonation scams, romance scams, and investment scams.
Table 1: 2024 APP Scam Cases
One scam that did increase in amount is the investment scam. This is becoming a real problem around the world. Table 2 shows the growth in investment scams, up 34% in 2024. The average loss for an investment scam is always higher than other scam losses. The average investment loss in 2024 was £18,500.
Table 2: 2024 APP Investment Scams
One scam category that declined in amount is the romance scam. Table three shows the value of romance scams dropped 17%. The hope here is that strong consumer education has helped to lower these losses.
Table 3: 2024 APP Romance Scams
Impersonation scams dropped for both “Police/Bank” and “Other” (e.g. utility company) impersonations. “Police/Bank” dropped by 16% and “Other” by 38% in 2024.
Table 4: 2024 APP Impersonation Police/Bank Staff Scams
Table 5: 2024 APP Impersonation Other Scams
The report has a key table, Payment Type, that shows the payment types the scam transactions used. As expected, this shows Faster Payments has the bulk of the scam activity, at 78% in 2024. Faster Payments used to be as high as 96% of APP scams.
Both intrabank transfers and International payment types, neither covered by the reimbursement program (although the Payment Systems Regulator informally requests payment service providers to reimburse intrabank transfers), grew in 2024, for a total of 12.4% of scam payments. Both effectively doubled in 2024. International payments are almost £50 million. It will be interesting to see if the scammers pivot to payment types that are not covered by reimbursement, thinking banks will not have as much protection for non-reimbursement transactions. See Table 6 for the details.
Table 6: 2024 APP Payment Types
What is still so troubling is the fact that most of these consumer scams start as a telephone call/text message or from the digital platforms. The report lists the source of these scams:
- Telecommunications: 36% of the amount of loss
- Online: (digital channels/dating sites) 29% of the amount of loss
- Email: 10% of the amount of loss
It is difficult to get these other players to participate in helping to reduce scams. There is some progress, especially when there is regulation forcing action. We see this in Australia with the Scam Prevention Framework. There is the Online Safety Act in the UK, but penalties have not yet kick in. Even Vietnam has a new regulation that holds banks, telcos and digital platforms accountable for adding scam prevention controls or be liable for scam losses.
Other Activities in the UK That Helps Reduce Scams
The UK has a number ‘whole-of-ecosystem” controls that help fight scams. The report mentioned several:
- The Banking Protocol: This is where branch staff can request local police help to convince customer to not complete a scam transaction. According to the report, this action prevented £61 million from being stolen in 2024 alone.
- Vulnerable Victim Notification: Law Enforcement can notify banks regarding customers vulnerable to scams. This occurred over 600 times in 2024.
- Scam Signal: The banks worked with the telcos to create an alert when a customer is doing a transaction online AND is on a call. This is also effective with card payments.
- The Best Practice Standards: A secure platform where banks and payment service providers share information relating to fraud and scams. The real-time capability helps to freeze scam money at the receiving bank.
- Online Safety Act: The legislation will require digital platforms to identify and remove scam ads and fraudulent search content.
Closing
So what do the 2024 UK APP scam statistics mean?
The UK is containing scam losses, but not effectively decreasing them. This has been accomplished by strong regulatory requirements around consumer scam controls and money mule controls. Plus, a mandatory reimbursement program to reimburse for most APP scams that mainly use the domestic faster payment rail.
The UK Finance report stated: “there is nothing to suggest it (the mandatory reimbursement) has had any impact on the perpetrators. If anything, it may have resulted in them focusing more on international payments (no reimbursement for international payments).” This is probably true, but what they fail to say is that the mandatory reimbursement is one of the key drivers for banks and payment service providers to have very strong scam controls and money mule management.
Reimbursement, along with the regulations around scam controls and money mule management, helped create the scam controls business cases for UK banks. As an example, as we look at the US, there is no regulation for scam controls and money mule management, and no reimbursement, and as a result, many financial institutions do not do much to help reduce consumer scams. And the US consumer scam losses skyrocket.
It is troubling to see investment scams, with higher losses, growing. And with the surge of crypto currency being the new ‘sure thing’ investment, we will see more losses.
Equally troubling is the power of GenAI. New releases by various vendors of their Large Language Models (LLMs) show revolutionary power to create video from just a picture and make the video speak in many languages with real-time interactive translation between the scammer and the victim. And now with Google new VEO 3 video LLM, video is not just good—it is great. Scammers will use these new capabilities to convince the victim they are the ‘person’ they claim to be.
Without strong controls and training, investment and romance scams will grow.
The elephant in the room is the digital platforms and telcos, who do not come close to pulling their weight in the fight against consumer scams (and that is also true for many banks outside the UK). Yes, they are doing some things. But we need bogus investment scam ads and websites taken down quickly. We need policing of consumer marketplaces to remove fraudsters. Dating sites need ‘bank’ level verification of members. Telcos need a better way to prevent scam text messages from getting to consumers. They need to better prevent fraudulent international calls. All banks around the world need to follow the UK example of scam controls and money mule management. These consumer scams are starting to impact bank safety and soundness!
The UK banks and payment service providers have very strong incentives to prevent scam losses from growing and hopefully force a meaningful downturn in the scam loss numbers. And they are succeeding to a degree. But this UK Finance report shows how hard it is without all the affected parties (banks, telcos, digital platforms, governments and the consumer) joining in the fight against what is truly transnational organized crime. Only then can we bend the scam curve down.",,"fraud, scam",2,2025-06-05,"UK Finance 2024 APP Scam Statistics | Outseer. UK Finance 2024 APP Scam Statistics

In today’s digital age, scams and fraud continue to evolve, posing a significant threat to individuals, financial institutions, and businesses. Two particularly concerning types of scams are social engineering and authorized push payment (APP) fraud, which are on the rise in the UK. Fraudsters employ psychological tactics and manipulation to deceive victims, making it essential to have robust prevention measures in place. Outseer, a leading fraud prevention company, offers solutions to safeguard against these scams and protect consumers and businesses.
Understanding UK Scams
In the United Kingdom, various scams target unsuspecting individuals. Among them are:
- Fake Websites: Deceptive websites, cleverly designed by fraudsters, convincingly masquerade as legitimate online stores. Shoppers, without realizing it, place orders and make payments for products that will never be delivered. This falls under the category of Card Not Present fraud, and we provide a dedicated exploration of how to counter this threat in our blog titled Unlock the Potential of Outseer 3-D Secure ACS: Empowering the Fight Against Scams.
- DPD Scam: Scam text messages and emails, purportedly from delivery company DPD, claim missed deliveries or request additional fees. Victims are directed to fraudulent sites to input personal information.
- Amazon Scam: Fraudsters impersonate Amazon through automated phone calls, claiming customers’ Prime subscriptions are expiring. They prompt individuals to press numbers, eventually obtaining personal details and potentially draining bank accounts.
- Royal Mail Scams: Scammers send emails, text messages, or make calls pretending to be Royal Mail, often requesting payments for rescheduled deliveries or underpaid postage. Falling for these scams can result in financial losses.
- Coupon Scams: Offers for discounts or special deals sent via text messages or WhatsApp may seem tempting but are often fraudulent, attempting to steal personal information.
- Job-Related Scams: Job seekers face scams that request upfront payments for security checks, training, visas, or insurance. Premium rate phone numbers are also used to accumulate charges. Work-from-home scams can lead to unwitting involvement in money laundering.
- Computer Service Software Fraud: Fraudsters pose as broadband providers, claiming technical issues that require remote access to victims’ devices. This access is exploited to steal money from bank accounts.
These scams involve social engineering tactics, manipulating individuals through fear, urgency, and deception. Victims often suffer financial losses and emotional distress. Financial institutions face significant reputational harm.
Outseer’s Comprehensive Approach to Scam Prevention

How Outseer Safeguards Against UK Scams, Social Engineering, and Authorized Push Payment (APP) Fraud
In today’s digital age, scams and fraud continue to evolve, posing a significant threat to individuals, financial institutions, and businesses. Two particularly concerning types of scams are social engineering and authorized push payment (APP) fraud, which are on the rise in the UK. Fraudsters employ psychological tactics and manipulation to deceive victims, making it essential to have robust prevention measures in place. Outseer, a leading fraud prevention company, offers solutions to safeguard against these scams and protect consumers and businesses.
Understanding UK Scams
In the United Kingdom, various scams target unsuspecting individuals. Among them are:
- Fake Websites: Deceptive websites, cleverly designed by fraudsters, convincingly masquerade as legitimate online stores. Shoppers, without realizing it, place orders and make payments for products that will never be delivered. This falls under the category of Card Not Present fraud, and we provide a dedicated exploration of how to counter this threat in our blog titled Unlock the Potential of Outseer 3-D Secure ACS: Empowering the Fight Against Scams.
- DPD Scam: Scam text messages and emails, purportedly from delivery company DPD, claim missed deliveries or request additional fees. Victims are directed to fraudulent sites to input personal information.
- Amazon Scam: Fraudsters impersonate Amazon through automated phone calls, claiming customers’ Prime subscriptions are expiring. They prompt individuals to press numbers, eventually obtaining personal details and potentially draining bank accounts.
- Royal Mail Scams: Scammers send emails, text messages, or make calls pretending to be Royal Mail, often requesting payments for rescheduled deliveries or underpaid postage. Falling for these scams can result in financial losses.
- Coupon Scams: Offers for discounts or special deals sent via text messages or WhatsApp may seem tempting but are often fraudulent, attempting to steal personal information.
- Job-Related Scams: Job seekers face scams that request upfront payments for security checks, training, visas, or insurance. Premium rate phone numbers are also used to accumulate charges. Work-from-home scams can lead to unwitting involvement in money laundering.
- Computer Service Software Fraud: Fraudsters pose as broadband providers, claiming technical issues that require remote access to victims’ devices. This access is exploited to steal money from bank accounts.
These scams involve social engineering tactics, manipulating individuals through fear, urgency, and deception. Victims often suffer financial losses and emotional distress. Financial institutions face significant reputational harm.

UK Supreme Court’s Ruling: A Shift in Bank Liability and Its Implications for Australia | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/uk-supreme-courts-ruling-a-shift-in-bank-liability-and-its-implications-for-australia,2023-09-20,"UK Supreme Court’s Ruling: A Shift in Bank Liability and Its Implications for Australia
The UK Supreme Court’s recent decision on authorized push payment fraud (APP fraud) has triggered significant discussions about banks’ responsibilities and their potential liability. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the critical aspects of this ruling and how it may influence Australian banks. We’ll also explore the escalating scam crisis in Australia and connect the dots between these issues.
Understanding the UK Supreme Court’s Decision
The UK Supreme Court’s decision in the Philipp case has fundamentally reshaped the way banks are held accountable for APP fraud. The court clarified that the question of whether banks should reimburse victims of such fraud is a matter of social policy for regulators and governments to decide. Importantly, the court emphasized that banks’ primary duty, when instructed by customers to make payments, is to execute those instructions promptly. The Quincecare duty, which applies when agents are involved in fraud, does not extend to cases of APP fraud.
Implications for the Australian Market
Although the UK Supreme Court’s decision is not legally binding in Australia, it carries significant implications for Australian banks. Historically, Australian banks have not faced liability for APP fraud, primarily relying on contractual obligations. However, the winds of change are blowing. The UK’s regulatory shift towards mandatory reimbursement for APP scams could inspire similar action in Australia as Financial Services Minister Stephen Jones gives the strongest indication yet on liability shift. While the government’s stance on this issue remains uncertain, the banking industry must remain vigilant and prepared.
The Escalating Scam Crisis in Australia
Now, let’s turn our attention to the alarming statistics from Scamwatch, which reveal the severity of the scam crisis in Australia:
- In 2022, Scamwatch received 239,237 reports, with reported losses exceeding $3 billion. Reported losses to Scamwatch alone reached $569 million, with an average loss of $19,654, marking a 224% increase from 2020.
- Investment scams accounted for $377 million in losses, followed by dating and romance scams at $40 million.
- People aged 65 and over bore the highest losses, making up 26.4% of total losses, while individuals aged 18-24 reported the fewest losses at 3.4%.
- Scammers primarily contacted victims via text messages (33%) and phone calls (29%).
The connection between the UK Supreme Court’s decision and the Australian scam crisis becomes clear when we consider the potential impact on Australian banks. As banks grapple with the question of liability, it’s crucial to remember the substantial financial losses incurred by Australian victims of scams. These losses highlight the urgency of addressing APP fraud and similar issues, even as the regulatory landscape evolves.
And while the UK Supreme Court’s ruling may not directly impact Australian banks, it serves as a catalyst for discussions around bank liability. The alarming scam statistics from Scamwatch underscore the urgency for Australian banks to adapt, protect their customers’ interests, and stay ahead of the evolving regulatory landscape, taking cues from the developments in the UK.

UK’s Faster Payment Regulations and Their Impact on Global Payment Systems | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/uks-faster-payment-regulations-and-their-impact-on-global-payment-systems,2023-07-17,"UK’s Faster Payment Regulations and Their Impact on Global Payment Systems
The Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) in the UK has introduced new regulations aimed at enhancing consumer protection against Authorised Push Payment (APP) fraud. These regulations, which ensure mandatory reimbursement for fraud victims, are set to have a significant impact on the UK’s payment landscape. However, the effects of these regulations are not limited to the UK alone. The global nature of financial systems means that changes in one country can have ripple effects on others. In this blog, we will explore how the proposed regulations in the UK may impact countries such as India, Australia, Malaysia, and Europe.
APP Fraud: A Global Challenge
Authorised Push Payment (APP) fraud is a rapidly growing problem worldwide, impacting individuals and businesses alike. In the UK alone, losses from APP fraud reached over £485 million in the past year. Recognising the devastating consequences of this type of fraud, the PSR aims to provide better protection for individuals making payments and encourage fraud prevention efforts across the payment ecosystem.
Strengthening Faster Payments and Pay.UK
One key aspect of the UK’s regulatory changes focuses on the Faster Payments system, which is where the majority of APP fraud occurs. The PSR intends to strengthen Pay.UK’s ability to tackle fraud by implementing new rules and incentivising payment firms to take action. Financial institutions can benefit from advanced fraud prevention solutions like Outseer Fraud Manager to bolster their fraud detection capabilities and comply with the enhanced security requirements of Faster Payments.
Consistent Minimum Standards and Reimbursement
Under the proposed regulations, consistent minimum standards will be established to protect customers. Financial institutions can leverage fraud prevention solutions to help them analyse user behaviour, detect suspicious transactions, and mitigate the risk of APP fraud. By implementing comprehensive fraud prevention measures, financial institutions can align with the reimbursement requirements and offer enhanced protection to their customers.
The PSR is set to achieve significant milestones in the coming years. By the end of 2023, they will publish crucial information, including the claim excess and maximum level of reimbursement, along with additional guidance on the customer standard of caution (gross negligence). Moreover, all legal instruments will be made public, ensuring transparency and clarity. Looking ahead to 2024, the new reimbursement requirement will officially come into force, solidifying the commitment to safeguarding consumers in the face of APP fraud.
Incentivising Payment Firms
The UK’s regulatory approach includes a cost-sharing mechanism, where both sending and receiving payment firms will split the costs of reimbursement equally. Financial institutions can utilise fraud prevention solutions like Outseer Fraud Manager to minimise fraud incidents and associated losses. By reducing the financial impact of fraud, financial institutions can mitigate the reimbursement costs and contribute to a more sustainable cost-sharing framework.
Potential Impact on Other Countries
The regulatory framework in the UK has the power to inspire countries worldwide to reassess their reimbursement policies and adopt consistent standards for stronger consumer protection. Several nations have already taken proactive steps to enhance their digital payment ecosystems, implementing their own fast payment systems while improving fraud prevention and security measures. These countries are closely monitoring the progress of the UK’s regulatory framework and actively participating in discussions and updates related to its implications. Here is a summary of key faster payment systems around the globe and any indications of their stance regarding the UK framework:
- India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) was introduced in 2016.

- Australia’s New Payments Platform was introduced in 2018.

This initiative allows customers of participating banks to make immediate payments 24/7, including weekends and holidays. The funds are transferred in real-time, providing instant confirmation to both the sender and the recipient of the payment.

Unmasking Money Mule Operations: The Fight Against Financial Fraud | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/unmasking-money-mule-operations,2023-12-07,"Unmasking Money Mule Operations: The Fight Against Financial Fraud
Money mule operations are a crucial component of financial fraud — you can’t rob a bank without a getaway driver. In this blog, we’ll delve into what money mule operations are, how fraudsters use them to cash out scammed money, and how Outseer’s cyber intelligence feeds can help financial institutions combat this menace.
Understanding Money Mule Operations
Money mule operations involve using willing co-conspirators or unwitting dupes to facilitate the transfer of illicit funds — either the proceeds of scams (or thieves) or other types of unclean assets. These individuals are typically recruited online and may be completely unaware of their involvement in criminal enterprises, or they may be the victim of scams themselves — promised a chance to “recover” stolen money.
Recent statistics have shown a sharp increase in the involvement of older victims in money mule activities, with a 29% rise in those over 40 acting as money mules. However, it is crucial to note that naive victims under 24 years old are the most likely demographic to participate.
The Anatomy of a Money Mule Operation
- Recruitment: Fraudsters recruit money mules through various channels, including job listings, social media, or online forums. They entice them with promises of easy money and minimal effort. Work from home offers or shipping agent offers are some of the most common “job” covers for money mule operations. As highlighted by UK Finance, money mule recruiters have adapted their tactics during the pandemic by posting fake job advertisements on websites and social media. Figures reveal a concerning trend, with over 17,000 suspected money mule cases involving 21- to 30-year-olds in 2020, marking a five percent increase from the previous year.
- Money Transfer: Once a money mule is recruited, they are instructed to receive funds into their bank accounts or e-wallets. This money is often stolen from unsuspecting victims.
- Cash Out: The mule’s primary role is to withdraw the funds and send them to the fraudsters, typically through untraceable methods like cryptocurrency or money transfer services.
Statistics from Lloyds Banking Group reveal that many people are unaware of the possible 14-year prison sentence as punishment for being involved in money mule activities. This lack of awareness makes it even more critical for financial institutions and individuals to stay vigilant. American federal-level law enforcement, like the US Secret Service or FBI, assert universal jurisdiction on cases involving US victims, US banks, or US dollars. Following extradition, participants in money muleing may face a minimum of six months up to, and including, a possible 20-year sentence.
The Role of Cyber Intelligence Feeds
Here’s where Outseer’s cyber intelligence feeds come into play. These feeds provide invaluable information to financial institutions, helping them flag and investigate accounts, addresses, or emails that are associated with money mule activity. This proactive approach is instrumental in the fight against financial fraud.
Uncovering Compromised Accounts and Money Laundering
In addition to flagging money mule activities, Outseer’s feeds can reveal compromised accounts and connections to money laundering schemes. This information is critical for financial institutions looking to protect their assets and reputation.
Cash laundered by money mules is used by criminals to facilitate serious crimes such as terrorism, drug trafficking, and people smuggling, underscoring the far-reaching consequences of these illicit activities.
Money mule operations are a key enabler of financial fraud, but with the right tools and intelligence, financial institutions can fight back. Outseer’s cyber intelligence feeds empower businesses to identify and combat money mule activities, ultimately safeguarding their finances and reputation.

Unmasking the Underground: Navigating the Threat of Dark Web Credit Card Marketplaces | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/unmasking-the-underground,2024-02-14,"Unmasking the Underground: Navigating the Threat of Dark Web Credit Card Marketplaces
Digital banking has transformed both consumer banking and the threats posed to banks and their customers. In addition to new scams and schemes targeting online banking customers, we have seen the evolution of criminal marketplaces to trade in stolen information, stolen accounts, and stolen money. This has been a particularly interesting history of development around stolen payment card information. In this exploration, we will look at the anatomy and recent history of these illicit platforms, with a specific focus on changes in the space since the notorious Joker’s Stash shut down, shedding light on the sale and trade of stolen payment information, the fracturing of the underground carder economy, and examining the impact on financial institutions and customers.
The Anatomy of Underground Credit Card Stores
Operating as shadowy corners of the internet, dark web credit card marketplaces facilitate the buying and selling of stolen payment cards. These platforms provide a marketplace for payment card data stolen by a variety of actors, leading to further specialization in crime. While criminals in the past might have stolen card data for their own reuse in carding, modern criminals split into those who capture and skim card data, and carders who take stolen card data and use it to make illicit purchases. Even skimming, which traditionally relied on capturing data from physical cards at point of sale has evolved into more technical approaches like Bluetooth enabled gas pump skimmers that can be used for weeks or months, e-skimmers like Magecart attacks that lift card data from ecommerce websites, and true cyberattacks like the Target and Sonic credit card breaches that compromised entire large commercial point of sale systems to steal card data in bulk.
Recent History and Trends
Over the past decade, Joker’s Stash emerged as one of the most infamous dark web marketplaces, gaining notoriety for illicit transactions and offering a plethora of stolen financial data. The platform, distinguished by the sophistication of its administrators, left an indelible mark on the cybercrime landscape, and became the central marketplace for stolen card data, outclassing all competitors.
The Rise and Fall of Joker’s Stash
Reaching its zenith as a notorious hub for stolen financial data, Joker’s Stash faced a significant setback when law enforcement agencies collaborated to take it down, along with many other high profile carding sites. This victory against cybercrime dealt a severe blow to the criminal underground, disrupting operations on one of the most prolific dark web platforms.
Aftermath and Resilience
Post the dismantling of Joker’s Stash, cybercriminals displayed adaptability by establishing new marketplaces to fill the void, highlighting the resilience of criminal enterprises. This adaptability underscores the ongoing challenge faced by financial institutions in combating the ever-evolving threat of dark web credit card marketplaces. Much like the situation after Silk Road was taken down, out of the ashes of Joker’s Stash, we have seen dozens of new carding data providers crop up, some specializing in particular regions or types of card data.
Impact on Financial Institutions and Customers
The repercussions of dark web credit card marketplaces, including the rise and fall of Joker’s Stash, extend beyond monetary losses. Financial institutions shoulder increased operational costs tied to investigating fraudulent activities and failed authentication attempts. Customers who lose their card data to fraud may turn to a different card while waiting for a replacement card, threatening the top-card effect of passing all spending across one preferred card. In some markets, like the US market, those interchange fee revenues can approach 3% of all transactions. Simultaneously, customers face the risks of identity theft, damaged credit scores, and the emotional toll of financial fraud.
Proactive Strategies and Technologies for Mitigation
In the relentless battle against cyber threats, financial institutions must deploy proactive strategies and technologies to mitigate risks and protect customers, especially in the context of compromised credit card feeds. Additionally, securing transactions with a 3-D Secure ACS (Access Control Server) solution plays a pivotal role in bolstering the overall fraud prevention strategy.
Leveraging Outseer FraudAction Compromised Credit Card Feeds
Financial institutions can proactively strengthen their defences by integrating intelligence derived from FraudAction. This involves leveraging insights from compromised credit card feeds into security protocols, enabling institutions to identify potential threats, block fraudulent transactions, and enhance overall risk management. This not only protects against financial losses but also reinforces customer trust. Rather than cancel cards when the customer reports fraud, banks can be aware of breached cards before fraud takes place, sending a replacement card on the spot and tightening fraud rules to decline any risky transactions in the meantime. This preserves customer experience and top card effect.
Securing Transactions with 3-D Secure ACS
Implementing a 3-D Secure ACS solution, like Outseer 3-D Secure, fortifies the fraud prevention strategy. This EMV® 3-D Secure ACS delivers a secure, frictionless digital shopping experience, providing a multi-layered defence against unauthorized transactions. By adding an extra layer of authentication, financial institutions reduce the risk of fraudulent activities during transactions. This proven technology, seamlessly working in the background, analyses transaction data and authenticates users in real-time, ensuring only legitimate transactions proceed.
This integrated approach, combining insights from FraudAction and the protection of Outseer 3-D Secure, enhances fraud prevention, positioning the institution as a guardian of customer trust in the dynamic fraud landscape.

US Senators Take Action on Consumer and Commercial Online Scams | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/us-senators-take-action-on-consumer-and-commercial-online-scams,2025-06-18,"US Senators Take Action on Consumer and Commercial Online Scams
The Proposal
On June 12, 2025, four US senators came together to announce plans to fight consumer and commercial online scams in the United States. Senators Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, and Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat were joined by Senators Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, and Raphael Warnock, a Democrat from Georgia, to propose a task force. These senators are proposing a bill to establish the Taskforce for Recognizing and Averting Payment Scams Act or the TRAPS Act.
The goals of the bill are:
- Study payment scams
- Suggest ways for lawmakers and regulators to combat scams, including formulating industry best practices.
The task force will be chaired by the US Treasury with a variety of members with key backgrounds to help identify and mitigate the problem of both consumer and business scams. Some of the members would include representatives from government (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Justice, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), banking, a credit union, a digital payment network, a consumer group and a technology or an industry representative from online platforms.
The bill proposes the task force undertake several key activities, including but not limited to:
- Examine current trends and developments in payment scams, identify effective methods for preventing such scams, and issue recommendations to enhance efforts to identify and prevent such activities.
- Adopt a cross-sector approach to ensure its recommendations reflect the full scope of the issue, given that scams impact individuals across a wide range of industries, including financial services, telecommunications, and technology (digital platforms).
- Review existing international solutions that can be applicable in the US to help mitigate this problem.
- Determining a strategy for education programs that better equip consumers to identify, avoid, and report payment scam attempts to the appropriate authorities.
- Coordinating efforts to ensure perpetrators of payment scams can be identified and pursued by law enforcement.
- Determining whether any additional Federal legislation would be beneficial for law enforcement and industry in mitigating payment scams.
The key outcome of the bill will be for the Taskforce, within one year, to report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives:
- The results of the reviews and evaluations of the Task Force.
- A proposed strategy identified to attack scams.
- Any legislative or regulatory recommendations that would enhance the ability to detect and prevent payment scams.
- Recommendations to enhance cooperation among Federal, State, local, and Tribal authorities in the investigation and prosecution of scams and other financial crimes, including harmonizing data collection, improving reporting mechanisms and streams, estimating the number of complaints and consumers affected, and evaluating the effectiveness of anti-scam training programs.
Why is This Important?
The US is woefully behind in fighting online scams. The FBI IC3 recently provided the 2024 scam loss numbers at $16.6 billion. And these are just reported losses. These scams include impersonation scams, romance scams, investment scams and business/vendor/real-estate email compromise scams.
Elder losses were over $4.8 billion with an average elderly loss of over $83,000. And elder losses increased 43% from 2023. These losses are financially and emotionally devastating.
If you include unreported losses, the number could exceed over $160 billion in 2024. The reported losses alone are increasing about 33% per year.
Most of these crimes start with a telephone call, a text message (or WhatsApp/Instagram message), someone meeting a criminal on social media/dating site, or involvement with a bogus ad or investment web site. Then the victim is psychologically groomed over time to send money via the banking payment rails. Sometimes, the scam can be much more immediate (we have kidnapped your granddaughter, your son caused an accident, or the help desk scam).
What is most important to understand is the criminals are international organized crime groups. And the monies stolen are used for drug trafficking, terrorism, weapons creation, human trafficking and more. This requires a national response to tackle these crimes.
What Are Other Countries Doing?
Several countries have done a better job at addressing consumer scams. The UK began in 2019 to require banks to have scam controls. The major UK banks also voluntarily began to reimburse Authorized Push Payment (APP) scam losses. Then in 2023, the regulators required banks add money mule controls. In 2024, new government legislation required banks to reimburse for consumer scam losses up £85,000.
In Australia, in 2023, the Australian Banking Association introduced the voluntary Scam-Safe Accord where banks agreed to create a scam strategy and add scam controls. In 2025, Australia passed the Scam Prevention Framework (SPF). The SPF will require banks, telcos and digital platforms to have scam controls and if they are not properly deployed, could require reimbursement for consumer scams. The SPF will go into effect in 2026.
Other countries, including Singapore, Thailand, New Zealand and the Philippines have added strong scam controls and requiring consumer reimbursement in certain circumstances. Singapore includes banks (and telcos in some cases), while Thailand involves banks, telcos and digital platforms (similar to Australia).
What Will Be the Outcome?
This Taskforce needs to create the urgency for the US government to act, but also banks, telcos and digital platforms need to step up with controls to help prevent these crimes.
It is also important to remember the Aspen Institute has an initiative underway to address consumer scams. This involves some of the same potential members the Taskforce will have. And the Aspen Institute will have a report out in late September.
Closing Thoughts
Although quite late, it is great to see these four senators come together in a bipartisan way to help fight online scams. We can learn a lot from the programs other countries have already initiated.
There are many proven solutions from around the world that can be applied to help banks, telcos and digital platforms fight these scams. Bogus online investment web sites and ads must be taken down. There must be proper KYC for dating sites and social media customers to help identify and remove criminals.
The US government needs to lead this fight. Government leadership has been absolutely essential for the success we see in these other countries.
A successful program must also eradicate the large scam compounds around the world, with pressure put on countries to shut these compounds down. Law enforcement must be funded to fight the other criminals physically in the US and other countries. The FBI, US Secret Service, Interpol and other international law enforcement agencies must continue to work together to arrest these criminals.

The Proposal
On June 12, 2025, four US senators came together to announce plans to fight consumer and commercial online scams in the United States. Senators Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, and Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat were joined by Senators Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, and Raphael Warnock, a Democrat from Georgia, to propose a task force. These senators are proposing a bill to establish the Taskforce for Recognizing and Averting Payment Scams Act or the TRAPS Act.
The goals of the bill are:
- Study payment scams
- Suggest ways for lawmakers and regulators to combat scams, including formulating industry best practices.
The task force will be chaired by the US Treasury with a variety of members with key backgrounds to help identify and mitigate the problem of both consumer and business scams. Some of the members would include representatives from government (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Justice, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), banking, a credit union, a digital payment network, a consumer group and a technology or an industry representative from online platforms.
The bill proposes the task force undertake several key activities, including but not limited to:
- Examine current trends and developments in payment scams, identify effective methods for preventing such scams, and issue recommendations to enhance efforts to identify and prevent such activities.
- Adopt a cross-sector approach to ensure its recommendations reflect the full scope of the issue, given that scams impact individuals across a wide range of industries, including financial services, telecommunications, and technology (digital platforms).
- Review existing international solutions that can be applicable in the US to help mitigate this problem.
- Determining a strategy for education programs that better equip consumers to identify, avoid, and report payment scam attempts to the appropriate authorities.
- Coordinating efforts to ensure perpetrators of payment scams can be identified and pursued by law enforcement.
- Determining whether any additional Federal legislation would be beneficial for law enforcement and industry in mitigating payment scams.
The key outcome of the bill will be for the Taskforce, within one year, to report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives:
- The results of the reviews and evaluations of the Task Force.
- A proposed strategy identified to attack scams.
- Any legislative or regulatory recommendations that would enhance the ability to detect and prevent payment scams.
- Recommendations to enhance cooperation among Federal, State, local, and Tribal authorities in the investigation and prosecution of scams and other financial crimes, including harmonizing data collection, improving reporting mechanisms and streams, estimating the number of complaints and consumers affected, and evaluating the effectiveness of anti-scam training programs.
Why is This Important?
The US is woefully behind in fighting online scams. The FBI IC3 recently provided the 2024 scam loss numbers at $16.6 billion. And these are just reported losses. These scams include impersonation scams, romance scams, investment scams and business/vendor/real-estate email compromise scams.
Elder losses were over $4.8 billion with an average elderly loss of over $83,000. And elder losses increased 43% from 2023. These losses are financially and emotionally devastating.
If you include unreported losses, the number could exceed over $160 billion in 2024. The reported losses alone are increasing about 33% per year.
Most of these crimes start with a telephone call, a text message (or WhatsApp/Instagram message), someone meeting a criminal on social media/dating site, or involvement with a bogus ad or investment web site. Then the victim is psychologically groomed over time to send money via the banking payment rails. Sometimes, the scam can be much more immediate (we have kidnapped your granddaughter, your son caused an accident, or the help desk scam).
What is most important to understand is the criminals are international organized crime groups. And the monies stolen are used for drug trafficking, terrorism, weapons creation, human trafficking and more. This requires a national response to tackle these crimes.
What Are Other Countries Doing?
Several countries have done a better job at addressing consumer scams. The UK began in 2019 to require banks to have scam controls. The major UK banks also voluntarily began to reimburse Authorized Push Payment (APP) scam losses. Then in 2023, the regulators required banks add money mule controls. In 2024, new government legislation required banks to reimburse for consumer scam losses up £85,000.
In Australia, in 2023, the Australian Banking Association introduced the voluntary Scam-Safe Accord where banks agreed to create a scam strategy and add scam controls. In 2025, Australia passed the Scam Prevention Framework (SPF). The SPF will require banks, telcos and digital platforms to have scam controls and if they are not properly deployed, could require reimbursement for consumer scams. The SPF will go into effect in 2026.
Other countries, including Singapore, Thailand, New Zealand and the Philippines have added strong scam controls and requiring consumer reimbursement in certain circumstances. Singapore includes banks (and telcos in some cases), while Thailand involves banks, telcos and digital platforms (similar to Australia).
What Will Be the Outcome?
This Taskforce needs to create the urgency for the US government to act, but also banks, telcos and digital platforms need to step up with controls to help prevent these crimes.
It is also important to remember the Aspen Institute has an initiative underway to address consumer scams. This involves some of the same potential members the Taskforce will have. And the Aspen Institute will have a report out in late September.
Closing Thoughts
Although quite late, it is great to see these four senators come together in a bipartisan way to help fight online scams. We can learn a lot from the programs other countries have already initiated.
There are many proven solutions from around the world that can be applied to help banks, telcos and digital platforms fight these scams. Bogus online investment web sites and ads must be taken down. There must be proper KYC for dating sites and social media customers to help identify and remove criminals.
The US government needs to lead this fight. Government leadership has been absolutely essential for the success we see in these other countries.
A successful program must also eradicate the large scam compounds around the world, with pressure put on countries to shut these compounds down. Law enforcement must be funded to fight the other criminals physically in the US and other countries. The FBI, US Secret Service, Interpol and other international law enforcement agencies must continue to work together to arrest these criminals.
We also need education on consumer scams and support for the victims of these crimes.
Many trade associations and consumers groups, including the American Bankers Association, AARP and the Electronic Transactions Association, support this legislation.

Payment Security: Everything You Need to Know | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/what-is-payment-security,2021-10-01,"Payment Security: Everything You Need to Know
We explain all aspects of payment security, the steps you can take to protect your organization and your customers’ data, and the obligations that come with it.
What Is Payment Security?
Payment security involves the steps businesses take to make sure that their customers’ data is protected and to avoid unauthorized transactions and data breaches. Important aspects of payment security include following protocols such as PCI Compliance and 3-D Secure (3DS).
Payment security has multiple layers and different requirements depending on the type of business you operate. With eCommerce showing no signs of slowing down, it’s more important than ever for credit card issuers and their merchant customers to implement robust payment security. Multiple layers of payment security are required to protect your business from processing fraudulent transactions, for which you could be liable.
Compliance plays a critical role in how payment security is designed and implemented. Let’s explore how one of the most common standards shapes payment security requirements.
Payment Security and PCI Compliance
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a standard that aims to make payment security consistent worldwide.
Any organization that processes, transmits, or stores cardholder data must comply with PCI DSS requirements. These requirements shape how payment security is implemented and evolve to reflect changes in new fraud prevention techniques.
How your business proves PCI compliance will depend on how many transactions you process annually. There are four merchant levels businesses can fall into, with Level 1 having the strictest requirements and Level 4 having the least.
For instance, at Level 4, merchants can demonstrate their compliance through a self-assessment, while Level 1 requires them to submit to an external audit conducted by a certified security assessor. Different integrations with payment gateways can lower a merchant’s required compliance level if the transaction takes place in the payment processor’s environment versus on the merchant’s own website.
No matter how many transactions you process, having the right payment security in place will help you pass PCI compliance and prevent fraudulent transactions in your business.
Types of Payment Security
Tokenization
Tokenization secures transactions by replacing payment information with randomly generated strings of characters. These tokens allow businesses to provision customer accounts, set up scheduled payments, and manage payment settings without handling sensitive cardholder information each time.
Tokens use a public and private key to work. The public key allows for token creation, while the private key allows the merchant to issue single or recurring payments. This form of payment security helps ensure cardholder data is stored securely and reduces the amount of times payment information is transmitted over the internet.
Address Verification Service (AVS)
AVS compares the address provided at checkout with the known address of the cardholder. The tool verifies whether or not the addresses match via a response code sent by the credit card company. While this is useful when paired with other methods of fraud prevention, by itself AVS is quite limited.
Typos, misspellings, and outdated address information can all inadvertently trigger an AVS mismatch, causing friction for legitimate customers. AVS alone cannot guarantee fraud protection, so it’s best to combine AVS with other forms of payment security.
SSL Protocol
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is an internet protocol that encrypts all communications on a website and is especially important for securing web pages that process customer payment information. Customers can see if a site is using SSL by searching their address bar for a lock icon or verifying that the site address begins with “HTTPS.” Many browsers now alert visitors when a site isn’t using SSL.
The good news: Acquiring an SSL certificate is both easy and affordable. Administrators can install SSL certificates to secure web applications and checkout pages; just be sure to renew your certificates before they expire. The bad news: Cybercriminals are increasingly acquiring SSL certificates for fraudulent sites.
Card Verification Value (CVV)
CVV is a three- or four-digit code on the back of a credit card designed to verify the purchaser has physical possession of the card. While CVV can certainly help prevent Card Not Present (CNP) fraud, it’s far from foolproof.
Data breaches can expose stolen CVV numbers, and fraudsters can simply physically write down your card information by hand. Like AVS, CVV is best used in conjunction with other payment security methods to provide an additional layer of security
3-D Secure (3DS)
3DS is one of the most widely used forms of payment security that continuously evolves to counter fraud. The power of 3DS comes from the data-rich information collected during and before checkout.
Information such as IP address, transaction history, and purchase amount are all factored in and analyzed for risk. In total there are over 100 data points collected regarding the cardholder, their device, and the nature of the transaction.
This information is shared among the acquirer bank, the issuer bank, and the supporting infrastructure for the protocol. All three parties work together to process the request, provide a risk assessment, and authenticate or challenge the transaction. This process uses statistical analysis to transform contextual information into a risk score for each transaction in just a few seconds.
If the transaction is deemed risky or there simply isn’t enough information to validate the transaction, the customer is sent through a challenge flow to provide additional identification. Common challenges include One-Time Passwords (OTP) sent via text or email. Unlike earlier versions of 3DS, only suspicious transactions are issued a challenge flow. This creates a frictionless experience for legitimate customers, improving conversion rates while protecting against fraud.
Payment Security Best Practices
One of the simplest ways to follow best payment security practices is to follow the PCI data security framework: Assess, Remediate, and Report.
Assess
Take inventory of your digital assets, and review your procedures for processing cardholder data. Most merchants can use the Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) to review their payment security. Larger companies processing a high amount of transactions annually may need to hire a Qualified Assessor to professionally audit their organization.
Remediate
Once payment security issues have been identified, they can be properly fixed. Remediation steps can consist of repairing misconfigurations, implementing encryption, or fixing vulnerable code. The assessment phase helps provide actionable steps to take during the remediation process.
Report
Regular reports are required to maintain PCI DSS compliance. PCI compliance is not enforced, meaning it’s up to the merchant to ensure their payment security meets the proper requirements. The level of reporting merchants need to provide depends on their merchant level.
What’s the Best Form of Payment Security?
Effective payment security offers many layers of protection without impacting the customer journey. 3DS makes it easy to protect your brand and customers at the same time, making it one of the best forms of payment security available.
Reduce Risk
3DS uses robust datasets and real-time fraud intelligence to significantly reduce the risk of fraud. Even if stolen card information is used to make a purchase, it is highly unlikely the fraudster will be able to complete the OTP challenge triggered by the 3DS challenge flow.
Customer Experience
The latest version of 3DS creates a seamless customer experience, unlike older methods of payment security. 3DS makes it easy for the customer to complete their transactions across multiple devices and inside mobile apps. By only issuing a challenge flow on suspicious transactions, 3DS provides one of the most customer-friendly solutions to fraud prevention.

Why Data Sharing Is the Key to Stopping Scams | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/why-data-sharing-is-the-key-to-stopping-scams,2025-10-08,"Why Data Sharing Is the Key to Stopping Scams
Global fraud prevention needs trusted, timely, and reciprocal data sharing—and Ken Palla’s Outseer whitepaper shows how to build best-in-class networks.
Ken Palla has written an extensive whitepaper for Outseer looking at the state of data sharing worldwide for fraud prevention and how increasing amounts of it are happening alongside legislative changes.
In the whitepaper, he looks at what constitutes global best practices for data sharing and the mechanisms behind it—with, unsurprisingly, the UK being highlighted as one of the leaders. But why is data sharing so important for fraud—particularly in dealing with scams?
Lessons From Early Bank-Bank Sharing
I want to draw on my own experiences around this; being a Brit I know firsthand the benefits of data sharing from my time working in a bank (much like Ken did). I helped create a cyber intelligence function within a bank many years ago and coordinated data sharing calls and mailing lists with my peers.
When I first began sharing intelligence with other banks, they were hesitant. From their perspective, why should I reveal the scale of attacks I was facing or the techniques being used? It seemed like I was giving them an advantage. Proactively showing them how to prevent fraud before it reached them.
At first, it did feel one-sided. But once trust developed, the dynamic changed. As soon as one bank shared intel back, the exchange became balanced. When multiple banks began contributing, the value multiplied. Each piece of intelligence built on the last, making the collective defense far stronger than anything we could achieve alone.
Six Principles for Successful Data Sharing
This is the thing about data sharing—it is the power of the network; by providing and receiving back information you all get benefit. But in my experience, there are some things that are needed for it to work:
- Trust – Sharing only to people or organizations you trust
- Mutualism – All participants need to contribute, not just consume
- Actionable – Intelligence must be specific and usable, not just informational
- Relevance – Must be appropriate to the group – or it cannot be used
- Timely – Share as soon as possible, or else the value is minimized
- Start small – Identity the initial usable data which can be shared
Sharing Across the Attack Chain
The main thing to think about when we look at data sharing is that fraud, and especially now Scams, cannot be stopped by just a single entity. The attack chain extends across many industries, including tech companies, telcos, banks and crypto. Data sharing highlights the true cost of the problem as well as helps reduce fraud losses.
Industry Groups Leading the Way
There is the need for data sharing organizations at both a local and international level. There are established groups already, such as CIFAS in the UK who focus on fraud, FS-ISAC who have experience from the infosec space, and GASA who have acted strategically with their Global Signal Exchange (GSE).
Other important sharing organsiations can be vendor led like Outseer’s Global Data Network. Proof of concept data sharing between industries such as banks and telcos, or tech companies, work across the Attack Chain.
Internal Data Sharing
Even within a single organization, data from one area of the bank can be successfully shared with other parts; the best example of this is the move over the past two years to take digital data from the fraud area of the bank and use it in the financial crime areas. Money mule detection has been the first recipient of this successful sharing, with a wider perspective of money launderers coming next.
Overcoming Legal and Regulatory Barriers
The positive news from Ken’s summary of global data sharing is it is becoming easier; there are less legal impediments to data sharing now. At the end of 2024, the UK Information Commissioners Office stated that a reluctance to share personal information to tackle scams and fraud can amount to a failure to protect their users from harm!
Asia is probably the most dynamic area for data sharing legislation, especially around looking for money mules. In Europe, GDPR is rightly, or wrongly, viewed as an impediment to fraud detection (although changes are happening).
What’s Next — Building a Blueprint for the Future
Ken has done a great job of not only showing how and where data sharing is happening but created a blueprint for what best-in-class looks like. This paper acts as a reference which can be used to influence senior stakeholders to undertake more sharing—helping protect consumers.

Global fraud prevention needs trusted, timely, and reciprocal data sharing—and Ken Palla’s Outseer whitepaper shows how to build best-in-class networks.
Ken Palla has written an extensive whitepaper for Outseer looking at the state of data sharing worldwide for fraud prevention and how increasing amounts of it are happening alongside legislative changes.
In the whitepaper, he looks at what constitutes global best practices for data sharing and the mechanisms behind it—with, unsurprisingly, the UK being highlighted as one of the leaders. But why is data sharing so important for fraud—particularly in dealing with scams?
Lessons From Early Bank-Bank Sharing
I want to draw on my own experiences around this; being a Brit I know firsthand the benefits of data sharing from my time working in a bank (much like Ken did). I helped create a cyber intelligence function within a bank many years ago and coordinated data sharing calls and mailing lists with my peers.
When I first began sharing intelligence with other banks, they were hesitant. From their perspective, why should I reveal the scale of attacks I was facing or the techniques being used? It seemed like I was giving them an advantage. Proactively showing them how to prevent fraud before it reached them.
At first, it did feel one-sided. But once trust developed, the dynamic changed. As soon as one bank shared intel back, the exchange became balanced. When multiple banks began contributing, the value multiplied. Each piece of intelligence built on the last, making the collective defense far stronger than anything we could achieve alone.
Six Principles for Successful Data Sharing
This is the thing about data sharing—it is the power of the network; by providing and receiving back information you all get benefit. But in my experience, there are some things that are needed for it to work:
- Trust – Sharing only to people or organizations you trust
- Mutualism – All participants need to contribute, not just consume
- Actionable – Intelligence must be specific and usable, not just informational
- Relevance – Must be appropriate to the group – or it cannot be used
- Timely – Share as soon as possible, or else the value is minimized
- Start small – Identity the initial usable data which can be shared
Sharing Across the Attack Chain
The main thing to think about when we look at data sharing is that fraud, and especially now Scams, cannot be stopped by just a single entity. The attack chain extends across many industries, including tech companies, telcos, banks and crypto. Data sharing highlights the true cost of the problem as well as helps reduce fraud losses.
Industry Groups Leading the Way
There is the need for data sharing organizations at both a local and international level. There are established groups already, such as CIFAS in the UK who focus on fraud, FS-ISAC who have experience from the infosec space, and GASA who have acted strategically with their Global Signal Exchange (GSE).
Other important sharing organsiations can be vendor led like Outseer’s Global Data Network. Proof of concept data sharing between industries such as banks and telcos, or tech companies, work across the Attack Chain.

Even within a single organization, data from one area of the bank can be successfully shared with other parts; the best example of this is the move over the past two years to take digital data from the fraud area of the bank and use it in the financial crime areas.

Why Outseer has Behavioral Biometrics: A Strategic Signal for Improving Fraud Detection | Outseer,https://www.outseer.com/blog/why-outseer-has-behavioral-biometrics,2025-10-13,"Why Outseer has Behavioral Biometrics: A Strategic Signal for Improving Fraud Detection
Transform fraud detection with behavioral intelligence that reveals attacker intent and customer authenticity.
We’ve been talking about the Outseer Behavioral Biometric product openly, but what has not been shared is the rationale for why we have chosen to develop this capability.
Obviously, any new product must have a tangible value to customers; there must be a return on investment to implementing it—both in terms of reducing total fraud losses but also improving operational efficiency.
Visualizing the Attacker Methodology
Behavioral Biometrics has emerged over the past 10 years as one of the most desirable components in a digital fraud management framework. The key value is that for the first time, defenders are able to envisage what the attackers are doing—not just at the device level but looking behind the device.
It allows fraud fighters to get into the mindset of thinking like the attacker—as a ‘Red Team’—by using the data points to illustrate intent and motive behind the digital journey interactions.
Pivoting of the Threat Landscape
Over the same time period, the fraud threat landscape has shifted on its axis—unauthorized fraud where the fraudster manipulates the customer account has been overtaken by authorized fraud where the customer themselves is manipulated.
Within Outseer, we are evolving ourselves, taking existing proven controls and enhancing them with machine learning and new signals. GenAI is accelerating the capabilities of fraudsters, which results in banks demanding improvements. To our mind, Behavioral Biometrics is just a signal—on its own it does not solve all problems—but it definitely brings unique insights which are otherwise missing.
Signal vs Noise Simplified
Risk engines need more data points that are specific to newer attack types, and that is what Behavioral Biometrics really delivers. By linking it into the context of the transaction (payee and value, current and historic), the device intel, and data from other channels, you bring down false positives.
Being able to do this natively in a single platform—without implementing a point solution—is how banks are now thinking, as they look to simplify vendor management and integration.
Identifying Earlier and Interdicting
Behavioral Biometrics is useful in identifying scams where the victim is guided in real time via the phone—it is very good at authenticating that it is the genuine customer making the payments, but also that they are acting atypically with signs of coercion. Layering it with signals such as active phone call and a new payee for a large amount improves accuracy.
Future developments based around behavioral insights look to be able to break the spell earlier before the payment. Subtle nuances in behavioral changes can be queried and context-based questions asked which seek to break the spell of the customer. Outseer is developing this as we speak, linking into the Behavioral Biometrics insights.
Regulations Catching Up with Innovation
The other reason for introducing Behavioral Biometrics is that of Regulatory Compliance—particularly for authentication in regions where Stronger Customer Authentication (SCA) is mandated. Behavior can prove it is the real user behind the device and simplify authentication journeys such as 3DS challenges by removing the need for a password. Other jurisdictions such as Malaysia are explicitly asking for client behavioral analysis in their regulations, and we expect this trend to continue to grow over time.
Reimagining the Platform
So, we’ve covered the value from a fraud and authentication perspective, and how Behavioral Biometrics helps solve the challenges that financial institution fraud teams face. From an Outseer perspective, it proves how we are evolving, with a lot of investment behind the scenes on people and machine learning capability. Behavioral Biometrics is just the first of the more visible enhancements we’re undertaking to enhance our platform.
End-to-End Capability That Is Integrated and Affordable
The Outseer fraud prevention platform gives cross-channel capability (Digital Banking and 3DS Cards) alongside intel about attacker activity in FraudAction. Behavioral Biometrics can be rapidly deployed for existing customers in a cost-effective manner and can also be linked with other signals.
Some scam types will not be stopped by just looking at the behaviors on the victim accounts—we need to look more at where the money is ending up. Our next capability is money mule detection by using transactional, non-transactional, and Behavioral Biometrics to detect risks across organizations.
Constant Improvement in the Face of Organized Adversaries
Our goal is to keep improving—to build on the heritage and scalability of our platform—and to demonstrate we understand the challenges financial institutions now face. Fraud has emerged as a critical threat to national security globally due to the scale of losses now seen.
Organized transnational crime groups dominate and, in some cases, are linked to Nation State or Terrorist sponsors. At Outseer, we strive to give a better view of risk across the entire fraud landscape for the sake of maintaining trust in digital channels.",,"fraud, scam",2,2025-10-13,"Why Outseer has Behavioral Biometrics: A Strategic Signal for Improving Fraud Detection | Outseer.
