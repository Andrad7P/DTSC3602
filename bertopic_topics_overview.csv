Defending Software that Defends Banks: Lessons from the Biggest Banking and Highest Threat Environments on the Planet\nWith the increasing number of cyber-attacks, the banking industry and its supply chain has become a prime target for attackers due to the valuable financial information they possess. The entire financial sector is considered a high-value target for hackers who seek to gain access to sensitive information or disrupt their operations. In this article, we will explore the lessons learned from defending a critical software service provider to the biggest banks and financial environments and the highest threat environments on the planet.\nThe Need for Defending Banking Software\nIn today’s digital age, banks heavily rely on 3rd party software and technology service providers to provide financial services to their customers. However, this reliance on technology also exposes banks to cybersecurity risks. Cybercriminals are constantly looking for vulnerabilities in banking software to steal financial data or conduct fraudulent activities. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that banking software is adequately protected to prevent such attacks.\n10 Lessons Learned from Defending Banking Software\n1. Develop and Adopt a Zero Trust Strategy\nZero trust is a security framework that assumes that all network traffic, both internal and external is potentially malicious. A zero-trust strategy will help service provider and banks to protect their assets and data from potential cyber threats. By implementing a least privilege access policy, multi-factor authentication, micro-segmentation, and monitoring and logging all network activity, companies can enhance their security posture and reduce the risk of a security breach.\n2. Implementing Strong Authentication Mechanisms\nOne of the most important lessons learned from defending banking software is the need to implement strong authentication mechanisms. Banks should require customers to use strong passwords and two-factor authentication methods such as biometric verification or SMS-based authentication. This will help prevent unauthorized access to bank accounts and financial data.\n3. Continuous Monitoring and Vulnerability Assessment\nContinuous monitoring and vulnerability assessment of banking software is crucial to identify and mitigate potential security threats. Banks should conduct regular penetration testing to identify any vulnerabilities in their software and implement necessary security measures to fix them. This will help prevent cyber-attacks and ensure that banking software is adequately protected.\n4. Develop a Strong Application Security\nAPI and application security are critical components of safeguarding all applications and software against potential security threats. APIs serve as the primary means by which different applications and systems interact with the service or the application, making them a prime target for potential attackers. Secure API and application security measures can include secure coding practices (SDLC), data encryption, strong authentication and access controls, strong DDoS protection, protection against application attacks and regular security testing and vulnerability assessments. It is also essential to have clear policies and protocols in place for managing API access, monitoring activity, and responding to security incidents. Service providers must also ensure that third-party applications and services that use their APIs comply with strict security protocols and adhere to industry standards. With effective API and application security measures in place, service providers can protect sensitive customer data, maintain the integrity of their applications, and minimize the risk of security incidents.\n5. Investing in Cybersecurity Solutions\nInvesting in cybersecurity solutions is essential to protect banking software and service environments from cyber-attacks. Banks should deploy advanced security solutions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions. These solutions will help detect and prevent unauthorized access to banking software and mitigate potential security threats.\n6. Data Protection as a lifestyle\nData protection is a critical concern in the entire financial sector, as they handle vast amounts of sensitive personal and financial information on a daily basis. Service providers and well as banks must implement robust data protection policies and procedures, including encryption, access controls, and regular security audits, to safeguard customer data. Additionally, service providers must train their employees on data protection best practices and ensure that all third-party vendors and partners also comply with data protection regulations. Failure to adequately protect customer data can result in severe legal and reputational consequences, including financial penalties, loss of trust, and damage to the company brand image. Therefore, data protection is an essential aspect of banking operations that must be taken seriously to protect both customers, service providers and the bank itself.\n7. Endpoint Detection and Response and Incident Response Automation\nEndpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and incident response automation are crucial tools for all organizations to quickly detect and respond to security incidents. EDR solutions monitor endpoints such as servers, personal computers, and mobile devices, detecting suspicious activity and alerting security teams to potential threats. Incident response automation streamlines the response process by automating repetitive tasks, such as collecting and analyzing data, and initiating incident response workflows. With automation, security teams can quickly investigate and respond to security incidents, minimizing the risk of data loss and business disruption. Organizations can also use automation to improve incident response planning by running simulations and identifying potential weaknesses in their response strategies. By combining EDR with incident response automation, organizations can detect and respond to security incidents more quickly and effectively, reducing the impact of attacks and mitigating the risk of future incidents.\n8. Educating Employees and Customers\nEducating employees and customers is crucial to prevent cyber-attacks on banking software. Banks should provide regular cybersecurity training to their employees to ensure that they are aware of the latest security threats and best practices to prevent them. Additionally, banks should educate their customers on safe online banking practices, such as not sharing their login credentials with anyone.\n9. Cybersecurity Compliance as the Minimum Standard\nCybersecurity compliance is a critical aspect of banking operations, as financial institutions face a constant threat of cyber-attacks. Banks and service providers that process financial data are required to comply with various regulations and standards to ensure the security and privacy of customer data and prevent financial fraud. Compliance frameworks such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS and PCI 3DS), A SOC 2 Type 2 is an internal controls report capturing how the service providers safeguards customer data and how well those controls are operating, and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provide guidelines for banks to establish robust cybersecurity policies and procedures. Compliance involves implementing a range of technical and organizational measures, including network security, data encryption, access controls, employee training, and incident response planning, to mitigate cyber risks and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial information.\n10. Collaborating with Industry Peers\nCollaborating with industry peers is essential to sharing knowledge and best practices for defending banking software. Service Providers should collaborate with other financial institutions in their eco-system to share threat intelligence and collaborate on cybersecurity solutions. This will help improve the overall security posture of the financial industry and prevent cyber-attacks.\nIn conclusion, defending banking software is crucial to prevent cyber-attacks and ensure that financial data is adequately protected. Service providers must implement strong authentication mechanisms, conduct regular vulnerability assessments, invest in cybersecurity solutions, educate employees and customers, and collaborate with industry peers to defend against cyber-attacks. By following these best practices, service providers can effectively defend their software against the highest threat environments on the planet.\nDefending Software that Defends Banks: Lessons Learned from the Biggest Banks\nWith the increasing number of cyberattacks, the banking industry and its supply chain have become a prime target for attackers due to the valuable financial information they possess. The entire financial sector is considered a high-value target for hackers who seek to gain access to sensitive information or disrupt their operations.\nWatch the webinar to learn about 10 best practices on how your supply chain should be protecting your data, including:\n- Developing and adopting a Zero Trust Strategy\n- Implementing strong authentication mechanisms\n- Developing strong application security\n- Data protection as a lifestyle\n- Cybersecurity compliance as the minimum standard\n- Collaborating with industry peers', 'FBI 2024 Fraud Statistics: UP, UP, and AWAY! | Outseer. FBI 2024 Fraud Statistics: UP, UP, and AWAY!\nIn April 2025, the FBI released its annual Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) fraud report. To no one’s surprise, the losses in 2024 grew. It is at $16.6 billion, up 33% from 2023. For the past five years, IC3 has reported $50.5 billion in cumulative losses. And that total is just for crimes reported by consumers and businesses.\nWhat is most interesting is how cleanly the IC3 breaks out the fraud data for analysis. So, let’s unpack this report. Chart 1 contains the crime type categories by dollars lost.\nChart 1: Crime Type Categories by Dollars Lost\nInvestment scams, at $6.6 billion have shot to the top, almost doubled since 2022. Business Email Compromises (BEC) have leveled off for the past three years at $2.8 billion, but still high given this fraud category began around 2011. Companies just don’t learn.\nTech Support scams are up $500 million since 2023 to $1.464 billion and have risen almost 87% since 2022.\nConfidence Fraud/Romance is up slightly since 2023 but down 9% since 2022. This is probably down, with the big increase in pig butchering (a combination of romance and investment) probably included under investment fraud.\nA few other interesting loss numbers:\n- Cryptocurrency was involved in $9.3 billion of the $16.6 billion total losses (56%). This was mainly in BEC and investment scams and some Confidence/Romance and Tech Support scams. In 2023, cryptocurrency was involved in 3.8 billion. So, there has been a 250% increase in the use of cryptocurrency in 2024.\n- 60+ (elderly) fraud losses were $4.8 billion (more on this later)\n- Gold courier scams had $219 million in losses. This is where scammers use couriers to pick up cash and gold from customers under one of many ruses. This is happening across the country. Here is a story in April 2025. “Two men were arrested for their involvement in ‘courier scams’ in Maryland, resulting in victims losing over $700,000.” In San Diego, CA, police have arrested many couriers for picking up gold and cash from victims, according to the San Diego District Attorney’s office.\n- Call center scams were up to $1.9 billion in losses. This was mainly in tech support and cryptocurrency exchange situations.\n- Average loss was $19,372.\nEvery age group is getting scammed. This is consistent with some recent information I received from a US bank which confirmed that all age segments are successfully being attacked by the scammers. The additional point they made was the vast majority of the losses were suffered by the elderly.\nChart 2 shows the numbers of scams and dollar losses by age group. You can see in the chart the number of reported incidents was fairly evenly spilt between the age groups. The last three age groups suffer the most because that is where more wealth has been built up.\nChart 2: Numbers of Scams and Dollar Losses\nThis year the FBI IC3 report has a special section on elderly fraud losses. It is important that the report has a special section on elderly fraud losses, as the losses per incident are much higher for the elderly and they have no time or ability to recoup these losses. These losses can be financially and emotionally devastating. The key elderly loss statistics are in Chart 3.\nChart 3: Key Elderly Statistics\nThe elderly lost $4.9 billion in 2023. The average reported loss for the elderly is now $83,000. These may be the most important statistics in this report. And 7500 complainants lost over $100,000. Also, there was a 43% increase in losses from 2023 for the elderly. This is a very disturbing trend.\nIn another section of the report, there is more breakdown of top elderly dollar losses by crime types: Investment losses for elderly were $1.8 billion, Tech Support was $900 million, Confidence/Romance was almost $400 million and government impersonation over $200 million. Cryptocurrency was involved in $2.8 billion of the fraud (58%).\nIt is exciting to see the newly established National Elder Fraud Coordination Center (NEFCC) open this month, just as the IC3 report was released. One of the primary goals of the NEFCC is to bring the criminals who attack the elderly to justice. Watch for important results as this year unfolds.\nWhen the fraudsters commit the fraud/scams, there are several key ways the money moves. Chart 4 shows this.\nChart 4: Top Ways Funds Are Lost in Fraud\nNotice how cryptocurrency and wire transfers lead the money outflow, with cryptocurrency the number one way. Some states are now limiting the daily crypto ATM deposit limit to $1000. This daily limit should be law in every state. Also, these statistics put financial institutions on call to add strong controls to prevent money mules. This includes strengthening account opening controls and having inbound transaction monitoring.\nThe report also breaks out losses by state. Chart 5 shows the top states by complaints and number of losses.\nChart 5: Top States by Complaints and Number of Losses\nWith the slow death of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), I think these state fraud loss numbers could become the catalyst for states to take action to require scam prevention from banks, telcos and digital platforms to help protect their constituents. Certainly, California and New York, two states with strong legislatures and existing strong consumer laws, could step up to help protect their constituents. In fact, in March, the California Senate held a hearing on Consumer Scams.\nThe 2024 Report also included several techniques the FBI deploys to recover losses and to prevent losses. The first technique is the Financial Fraud Kill Chain. According to the report: “the IC3 Recovery Asset Team streamlines communications with financial institutions and FBI field offices to assist in the freezing of funds for victims of fraudulent domestic and international transactions via the Financial Fraud Kill Chain. Most Financial Fraud Kill Chain incidents initiated by the IC3 RAT are Business Email Compromise (BEC). The Financial Fraud Kill Chain can also be initiated for Tech Support Fraud, Romance Scams, and Data Breaches.” Chart 6 show a five-year history of the Financial Fraud Kill Chain\nChart 6: Financial Fraud Kill Chain (5 Years)\nThe second technique is Operation Level Up. The report says: “Launched in January 2024, Operation Level identified victims of cryptocurrency investment fraud and notified them of the scam. Operation Level Up notifies victims while the scam is in process. The operation was initiated with the support of agents from FBI and the U.S. Secret Service.” This primarily has involved crypto currency investment frauds, known as pig butchering. Below are the results:\nSuccess Stories\nUtilizing IC3 complaint data, Operation Level Up reported:\n- 4,323 victims of cryptocurrency investment fraud were notified.\n- 76% of those victims were unaware they were being scammed.\n- Estimated savings to victims of $285,639,989.\n- 42 victims referred to an FBI victim specialist for suicide intervention.\nThe third technique involved shutting down scam call centers. The report went on to say: “Since 2022, the DOJ, FBI, and IC3 have collaborated with law enforcement in India, such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in New Delhi and local Indian states, to combat cyber-enabled financial crimes and transnational call center fraud.” The success of this technique is shown below:\nSuccess Stories\n- FBI responded to over 38 requests from law enforcement in India and provided approximately 60 actionable leads.\n- FBI enabled over 215 arrests through 11 joint operations with the CBI and other local law enforcement in 2024. This represented a 700% increase in arrests from 2023, the first full year of the collaboration.\n- FBI conducted hundreds of interviews and continues to support Indian law enforcement efforts and prosecution of call centers perpetrating these frauds.\nUnfortunately, many of the very large scam call center/compounds are in lawless Myanmar and will be difficult to shut down. China has had limited success shutting down some scam compounds in Myanmar. Other scam compounds are located in Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines, parts of the Middle East and Latin America.\nConclusion\nThe FBI IC3 2024 Internet Crime Report echoes what we saw in the recent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 2024 Sentinel Report. Both reports showed about a 25–33% increase in fraud from 2023. The dollar range between the two reports is $12.5–$16.6 in annual reported fraud.\nPerhaps the most disturbing statistics were from the elderly age group.\n- $4.9 billion lost\n- Average loss was $83,000\n- 43% increase in losses from 2023\nWe definitely need to provide better protection for the elderly to prevent these crimes.\nUse of cryptocurrency in the reported losses exploded from $3.8 billion in 2023 to $9.3 billion in 2024. This is a 250% increase in 2024. And the largest age group with cryptocurrency losses was the elderly at $2.8 billion.\nSince maybe only 5–10% of fraud losses are reported, we can estimate total fraud losses at $150–200 billion per year in the US. These are stunning numbers!\nEven with these massive loss numbers, the US still has no national strategy to combat consumer scams, which make up a large portion of these losses. Why is a national strategy/attack plan so crucial? Because the scammers are no longer just individuals. It is transnational organized crime attacking individual consumers, picking them off one by one. The UN and Operation Shamrock have identified massive scam compounds in Southeast East Asia (and elsewhere) with hundreds of thousands of scammers with the sole focus of stealing money from consumers in almost every country in the world.\nThere is another ominous threat for the US. With several English-speaking countries actively deploying scam prevention controls (the UK, Australia and New Zealand), the scammers will put more emphasis on the US, a country that has no requirements for scam controls or money mule controls. So, expect the numbers to grow in 2025.\nThere are, however, two potential bright spots in the US. In April 2025, the National Elder Fraud Coordination Center (NEFCC) opened in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. CEO Brady Finta, former FBI Supervisory Special Agent, is putting together a team to work with law enforcement and private sector companies to help aggregate elder Individual fraud cases into large cases and go after the criminals. This is patterned after the successful San Diego Elder Justice Task Force.\nThe second initiative is the Aspen Institute National Task Force for Fraud & Scam Prevention. This task force includes financial institutions, digital platforms, telcos, consumer non-profits and the US government. The goal of this task force is to define actionable solutions to prevent fraud and scams in the US. These solutions will be announced in Q4 2025.\nBut now, US financial institutions, where the money leaves the scam victim accounts, need to do more. They should follow the lead of the UK, Australian and New Zealand bankers and add a scam strategy with scam controls and money mule controls. Digital platforms that operate in the US need to add the same controls they are already deploying in the UK and Australia. Telcos need to do more to block international scam calls and to block scam text messages. We continue to see a more aggressive telco response in the UK, Europe and Australia.\nAlso, more states should have laws that 1) allow banks to hold suspicious transactions involving elderly customers with a safe harbor for banks and 2) have daily limits on crypto ATM deposits and 3) require elderly bank customers to name a “trusted person” for banks to notify for suspicious transactions.\nWe can make a difference in the US, but it requires a whole-of-ecosystem response with individual entities and government committed to actional solutions to fight these scams.', 'Payment Fraud: What It Is & How To Prevent It | Outseer. Payment Fraud: What It Is & How To Prevent It\nWe give a detailed explanation of what payment fraud is, how it can affect your organization and your customers, and top strategies for preventing it.\nWhat Is Payment Fraud?\nPayment fraud occurs when someone uses misappropriated payment details to make unauthorized transactions in order to steal money or property.\nTypes of payment fraud include:\n- CNP payment fraud\n- Chargeback fraud (friendly fraud)\n- Account takeover\n- Account enrollment fraud\nMost forms of financial fraud involve impersonation or identity fraud, accounting for as much as $56 billion in losses per year, according to the 2021 Identity Fraud Study from Javelin Strategy & Research. And there are no signs of slowing down. As more businesses utilize digital channels to serve their customers, fraudsters seek new ways to exploit them.\nThis can include scams designed to steal credit card, P2P payments, and other account information in order to make illicit transactions. It can also entail the use of compromised login credentials to hijack bank and payment accounts in account takeover (ATO) attacks—either directly or through the use of automated bots.\nIt can also entail so-called “friendly fraud” through which unscrupulous customers abuse “returnless refunds” and other forms of chargeback fraud to attain merchandise without having to pay for it.\nIncreasingly, it can also involve falsified account enrollment, where fraudsters use synthetic identity information to open bank, credit card, and new payment forms such as Buy Now, Pay Later accounts.\nExamples of Payment Fraud\nBelow we’ll explore the different types of payment fraud, explain how the attack works, and what you can do to defend your business from it.\nCNP Payment Fraud: A Growing Problem\nCard-not-present (CNP) fraud has risen sharply during the ecommerce boom triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Aite-Novarica Group CNP fraud could lead to $17.2 billion in lost revenue annually. To mitigate this threat, financial services organizations, credit card companies, and others are layering in new defenses against CNP fraud, but with varying success.\nFor instance, confirming CNP transactions with the customer via text message has been a growing trend, especially when the amount being transacted is unusually high. In practice, however, this can create friction that can lead impatient consumers to abandon the purchase, never to return. As it stands now, as much as 88% of online shopping orders are abandoned, according to Statistica.\nKnowing how CNP fraud works is vital to understanding how to stop it without creating friction for legitimate transactions.\nFraudsters carry out CNP fraud through the following methods:\n- Engaging in phishing scams – CNP fraud often occurs through online phishing scams, where criminals create malicious clones of real websites that steal customer information. These phishing campaigns are usually spread via email, but they can also spread through text messages, fraudulent social media pages and rogue mobile apps.\n- Facilitating fraudulent business purchases – This can also occur at restaurants where dishonest employees hand-copy credit card information before processing your transaction.\n- Exploiting data compromised through data breaches – But by far the most common way fraudsters obtain stolen credit card information is via Dark Web marketplaces where the card and other personal information is harvested from data breaches.\nYou can prevent CNP fraud by doing the following:\n- Require billing address (AVS) & CVV verification\n- Take down phishing sites impersonating your brand to reduce credentials harvesting\n- Implement solutions that leverage and enhance the EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS) payment authentication protocol\nChargeback Fraud (Friendly Fraud)\nChargeback fraud occurs when a customer initiates a chargeback through their bank for a product they already received. When this happens accidentally, for instance, if a customer forgot they placed the order, it is referred to as friendly fraud. Unfortunately in both cases, chargeback fraud cuts into profits through chargeback fees and chips away at inventory.\nFraudsters carry out chargeback fraud through the following methods:\n- Claiming they never received the product – The customer keeps the product, then issues a chargeback stating they never received it.\n- Claiming they never authorized the purchase – The customer orders the product, receives it, but then initiates a chargeback claiming they did not make the purchase.\n- Simply forgetting they ordered the product – Sometimes customers forget they make purchases, especially if shipping is delayed, causing them to dispute the charge once they see it on their statement.\n- Abusing “returnless refund” policies – Fraudsters or even everyday consumers exploit policies that allow them to receive a full refund for an item without having to return it, in order to save the business shipping and processing costs.\nIn one recent survey, 44% of merchants report experiencing return abuse of some kind in the last 12 months, and 66% say it’s getting worse. But preventing this form of payment fraud before it happens can be tricky.\nNew fraud detection methods can prevent chargeback fraud before the transaction is completed thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning.\nYou can prevent chargeback payment fraud by doing the following:\n- Confirming all orders via email/text\n- Reminding customers of recurring payments\n- Applying frictionless transaction monitoring in your business\n- Using recognizable transaction descriptions\nAccount Takeover\nCriminals use account takeover attacks to commit payment fraud using payment details on file or stolen payment information. The price tag: As much as $16.9 billion per year. According to HelpNet Security, ATO attacks increased 307% between 2019 and 2021. This can be tough for businesses to spot because transactions are coming from a legitimate cardholder or customer account, when, in fact, it has been stolen.\nOnce inside the stolen account, attackers can transfer money, update billing information, and even set illegitimate beneficiaries.\nFraudsters steal customer accounts through the following methods:\n- Sending phishing messages – Victims unknowingly log in to a malicious clone of a trusted website where attackers copy their account information.\n- Installing malware – Spyware allows attackers to see the keystrokes and actions of a customer.\n- Rogue mobile apps – The installation of fraudulent branded apps designed to fool victims into revealing login credentials increased 49% just within the third quarter of 2021.\n- Credential stuffing – Criminals purchase entire databases of stolen account information on the dark web and then use software to test and validate passwords that haven’t been changed.\nThat last point is key. ATOs fueled by data breaches increased 850% between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021. With login credentials so readily available, the trick to stopping account takeover is to recognize fraudulent transactions and logins from legitimate accounts. One of the best ways to prevent this form of payment fraud is to use a fraud prevention system. These services use data science and machine learning to distinguish normal account behavior from fraudulent activity—no matter who is signed into the account.\nYou can prevent account payment fraud by doing the following:\n- Offering two-factor authentication to your customers\n- Preventing fraudulent logins with a fraud prevention system\n- Setting login attempt limits to prevent credential stuffing\n- Training staff to identify the signs of an account takeover\nAccount Enrollment Fraud\nIncreasingly, cybercriminal networks use small pieces of stolen identity information to stitch together fraudulent, or “synthetic” identities that can be used to open credit card, banking, BNPL, and other payment accounts, as well as apply for loans.\nSynthetic identity fraud is a $6 billion problem that the FBI calls one of the fastest-growing forms of financial crime. In fact, the American Bankers Association reports the average synthetic identity profile is used to successfully steal between $81,000 and $97,000.\nYou can prevent synthetic identity fraud by doing the following:\n- Use machine learning-based account enrollment fraud prevention solutions\n- Verify each piece of new customer information during account registration.\n- Automatically monitor all transactions for signs of fraud\n- Keep up to date with identity screening best practices\n- Use anti-fraud systems that leverage global data-sharing networks\n- Apply extra scrutiny to account applicants using CPNs rather than an EIN or SSN.\nStopping Fraud, Not Transactions\nPayment fraud and the myriad avenues for fraudsters to perpetrate it can feel overwhelming. But you don’t have to handle it alone.\nOur own solutions, for instance, empower the digital economy to grow by authenticating billions of transactions annually. Our payment and account monitoring solutions increase revenue and reduce customer friction for card issuing banks, payment processors, and merchants worldwide.\nBy leveraging intelligence from 20 billion annual transactions across 6,000 institutions contributing to our global data network, our identity-based science prevents 95% of all fraudulent transactions, with customer intervention rates as low as 5%. That’s the best performance in the industry.\nBy seeing what others can’t, we stop fraud long before an account is created or a fraudulent transaction occurs.

Faster Payments, Faster Fraud: Examining the Challenges of Faster Payment Systems’ Mass Adoption in India, the UK, Malaysia, and Australia\nThe adoption of faster payment systems has revolutionised transaction processes in countries such as India, the UK, Malaysia, and Australia. These systems offer unparalleled convenience and speed, but they also bring about a new challenge: fraud. As the popularity of faster payment systems grows, fraudsters have swiftly adapted their tactics to exploit vulnerabilities within these systems. This poses significant challenges for both financial institutions and regulators.\nA report commissioned by Outseer shed light on the trends associated with different forms of payment fraud attacks. According to the report, 57% of surveyed financial institutions noted an increase in mule activity over real-time payment rails in 2022 compared to 2021. Furthermore, 71% reported an increase in consumer Account Takeover (ATO) using real-time payment rails, while 62% observed a rise in consumer authorised push payment (APP) fraud via real-time payment rails.\nThese alarming statistics highlight the urgent need for robust measures to mitigate fraud risks within the context of faster payment systems. Financial institutions and regulators in India, the UK, Malaysia, and Australia are actively addressing this issue through the implementation of various strategies and safeguards.\nIn this blog, we will explore the faster payment systems in India, the UK, Malaysia, and Australia, and delve into how regulators are supporting and protecting customers in these countries. We will examine the key features and advancements of these payment systems that have transformed the way transactions are conducted. Additionally, we will delve into the regulatory frameworks and measures implemented to ensure customer protection, enhance security, and mitigate fraud risks. By understanding the evolving landscape of faster payment systems and the regulatory efforts in place, we can gain insights into the initiatives taken to foster a safe and efficient environment for customers globally.\nRapid Adoption and Fraud Challenges\nFaster payment systems, such as Brazil’s Pix, India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Australia’s New Payments Platform (NPP), Malaysia’s DuitNow, and UK’s Faster Payments Service have experienced remarkable growth, surpassing traditional payment methods. Unfortunately, fraudsters have wasted no time in capitalising on these systems. They employ various techniques, including social engineering, to deceive unsuspecting consumers into voluntarily sending funds to them. This rise in fraud attacks, particularly mule activity and consumer-authorised push payment (APP) fraud, has compelled financial institutions and regulators to be on high alert.\nFaster payment systems in India, the UK, Malaysia, and Australia and The Growing Menace of APP Scams\nIndia: Unified Payments Interface (UPI)\nIndia’s UPI has witnessed tremendous growth, driven by central bank incentives and the efforts of telecom companies to promote digital payment adoption. With its user-friendly interface and seamless transaction experience, UPI has become the preferred choice for person-to-person and person-to-merchant payments. However, the rapid adoption of UPI has also attracted the attention of fraudsters. They exploit the trust and convenience associated with UPI to carry out scams such as fake payment requests, phishing attacks, and fraudulent merchant transactions. Financial institutions and regulators in India are actively working to enhance security measures and educate users about potential risks.\nSecurity improvements in the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system include:\n- Two-Factor Authentication: To enhance security, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has mandated the implementation of two-factor authentication for UPI transactions. This ensures that users have to provide additional verification, such as a PIN or biometric authentication, to authorise transactions, making it harder for fraudsters to gain unauthorised access.\n- Transaction Limits: The NPCI has set transaction limits for UPI payments, both per transaction and per day, to minimise the impact of potential fraud. By imposing limits, the system reduces the risk of significant financial losses in case of fraudulent transactions.\n- Strong Customer Authentication (SCA): The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has introduced SCA guidelines, requiring banks and payment service providers to implement strong customer authentication methods. SCA involves multiple layers of authentication, such as one-time passwords (OTP), biometrics, or device recognition, to ensure the legitimacy of transactions and protect users from unauthorised access.\nUK: Faster Payments Service (FPS)\nThe UK’s Faster Payments Service (FPS) has transformed the payments landscape, enabling near-instantaneous transfers between individuals and businesses. While the introduction of FPS has provided convenience and efficiency, it has also opened new avenues for fraud. Fraudsters take advantage of the speed and irreversibility of FPS transactions to trick victims into authorising payments to fraudulent accounts. Common scams include invoice redirection fraud, romance scams, and investment fraud. UK financial institutions and regulatory bodies have implemented measures to combat fraud, including secure authentication protocols, fraud detection systems, and public awareness campaigns.\nUK regulators have been actively addressing the issue of APP fraud by implementing various measures. The introduction of the voluntary Contingent Reimbursement Model (the code) aimed to reimburse victims of scams. However, recent developments indicate a shift towards mandatory reimbursement legislation, holding institutions accountable for combating fraud.\nPSR (Payment Systems Regulator) has recently outlined new regulations for the UK’s Faster Payments scheme. Under these rules, participants in the scheme will be required to share the cost of reimbursing victims of authorised push payment (APP) fraud; this will come into force in 2024. Alongside reimbursement, the regulator is increasing transparency through the publication of data on how well firms are protecting customers from fraud, promoting intelligence-sharing to spot and prevent fraudulent transactions, and expanding the roll-out of the name-checking service Confirmation of Payee.\nMalaysia: DuitNow\nDuitNow is the faster payment system in Malaysia that enables instant fund transfers between participating banks and e-wallets. It was introduced by Payments Network Malaysia Sdn Bhd (PayNet), the national payment network and shared central infrastructure provider in Malaysia. DuitNow aims to provide a convenient, secure, and efficient way to transfer money in real time.\nThe increased adoption of DuitNow in Malaysia has unfortunately coincided with an increase in authorized push payment (APP) fraud, particularly through the notorious Macau scam. However, DuitNow has implemented several aspects to provide a safer environment for users, mitigating the risks associated with such fraudulent activities.\nHere are some key aspects of DuitNow that enhance customer protection:\n- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Many participating banks and e-wallet providers have implemented two-factor authentication as an additional layer of security. This requires users to provide a second form of verification, such as a One-Time Password (OTP) or biometric authentication, to authorise transactions. 2FA adds an extra level of protection against unauthorised access to user accounts.\n- Transaction Limits: Participating banks and e-wallet providers have set transaction limits to mitigate the impact of potential fraud. These limits restrict the maximum amount that can be transferred or paid through DuitNow. By imposing transaction limits, the risk of large-scale fraudulent transactions is reduced, providing better protection to customers.\n- Customer Education and Awareness: Financial institutions and regulatory bodies have been actively educating customers about safe banking practices and raising awareness about common fraud techniques. Through various channels such as websites, mobile apps, and customer support, users are provided with guidance on how to protect themselves from fraud, including tips on securing personal information and recognising phishing attempts.\n- Enhanced Fraud Detection and Investigation: Collaborative efforts between financial institutions, law enforcement agencies, and regulatory bodies have been strengthened to combat fraud more effectively. Sharing of information and intelligence helps identify trends, track down fraudsters, and facilitate investigations. This proactive approach enables quicker response times and the potential recovery of funds in cases of fraud.\n- Regular System Upgrades and Security Audits: PayNet, the entity responsible for DuitNow, regularly performs system upgrades and security audits to identify vulnerabilities and address any potential weaknesses. This ensures that the infrastructure supporting DuitNow remains robust and up-to-date in the face of evolving fraud techniques.\n- Continuous Improvement: PayNet, financial institutions, and other stakeholders involved in the DuitNow ecosystem are committed to continuous improvement. They actively seek feedback from users and monitor industry best practices to refine the system’s security measures. This ongoing commitment to improvement is crucial in staying ahead of fraudsters and maintaining customer trust.\nAustralia: New Payments Platform (NPP)\nAustralia’s New Payments Platform (NPP) has revolutionised the way Australians make payments, offering real-time transfers and the convenience of using mobile phone numbers or email addresses as payment identifiers. The adoption of NPP has gained significant momentum, with more financial institutions and businesses joining the platform. However, this increased usage has also attracted the attention of fraudsters. Scams targeting NPP users include impersonation scams, where fraudsters pose as legitimate recipients of funds and requests for payment under false pretenses. Financial institutions and regulators in Australia are collaborating to enhance security measures and promote consumer education to mitigate the risks associated with NPP transactions.\nOne effective tool within the NPP system is PayID, an addressing service that allows users to link their phone numbers or email addresses to their accounts for seamless real-time payments. Research commissioned by NPP Australia reveals that one in four PayID users have successfully prevented mistaken payments by editing or halting transactions, showcasing the significant role PayID plays in combating fraud and safeguarding users’ funds. PayID simplifies payments by replacing the need for complex BSB and account numbers, and transactions can be conveniently conducted through a bank’s internet or mobile banking app. Additionally, PayID enhances security by displaying the recipient’s name before finalizing a payment, reducing the risk of falling victim to fraudulent transactions.\nTo further bolster security, regulatory bodies such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) oversee payment systems and financial transactions in Australia. These entities actively work to enhance regulations and legislation related to scams targeting the NPP. This includes strengthening consumer protection laws and imposing stricter obligations on financial institutions to prevent fraud, for example:\n- Industry Codes of Practice: In collaboration with industry stakeholders, the Australian Payments Network (AusPayNet) has developed the ePayments Code. This code sets out best practices and standards for electronic payments, including addressing liability and reimbursement for victims of APP scams. It provides a framework for financial institutions to follow and promotes transparency, fairness, and accountability in the payments ecosystem.\n- Reporting and Data Sharing: The government encourages financial institutions to report instances of APP scams and share information on fraudulent activities with regulatory authorities. This facilitates the identification of emerging trends, the implementation of proactive measures, and the development of effective strategies to combat scams.\n- Collaboration and Coordination: Government agencies, including ASIC and AUSTRAC, collaborate with industry participants, law enforcement agencies, and consumer advocacy groups to coordinate efforts in combating APP scams. This collaboration ensures a comprehensive approach to addressing fraud, sharing intelligence, and raising awareness among the public.\n- Reimbursement Framework: The government is actively working on a reimbursement framework for victims of APP scams. The objective is to establish clear guidelines and standards for financial institutions to provide timely and fair reimbursement to customers who have fallen victim to fraudulent transactions. This reimbursement framework aims to strike a balance between protecting consumers and ensuring the accountability of financial institutions.\nA proactive stance and the adoption of a multi-layered approach are needed\nAs faster payment systems continue to gain popularity worldwide, the fight against fraud becomes an ongoing challenge. Financial institutions, regulators, and users must collaborate to implement robust security measures, remain vigilant against emerging scams, and continually educate themselves about fraud risks. By staying proactive and adopting a multi-layered approach to fraud prevention, countries like India, the UK, and Australia can ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of their faster payment ecosystems, protecting consumers from falling victim to scams.', 'Insights from Outseer’s Global Fraud & Scams Trends Report | Outseer. Insights from Outseer’s Global Fraud & Scams Trends Report\nAs cyber fraud evolves, our strategies must advance as well. Outseer’s annual 2024 Global Fraud & Scams Trends Report provides crucial insights for financial institutions.\nBased on data from Outseer’s FraudAction 24/7 Anti-Fraud Command Center (AFCC), this report summarizes key cyber threats from the past year. With 20 years of data gathered from hundreds of clients worldwide, we have gained unique insights into the continuously evolving fraud trends.\nOutseer’s analysis of global fraud trends across various attack vectors in 2023 reveals the year-over-year changes in the overall volume of attacks. Below you can find a summary the changes and key trends:\nKey Trends\nTrend 1: Banking Trojans and Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)\nWhile the volume of fraud observed grew 108%, malware attacks overall grew a staggering 4,000% or 40X growth in volume, partially due to the increase of malware in mobile channels. This surge was driven by the increase in Malware as a Service, where non-technical fraudsters access malicious software for a fee. Notable malware families include Hydra, Cerberus, and Octo, all contributing to increased Command-and-Control (C2) infrastructure.\nWhile phishing saw a moderate attack increase, brand abuse and rogue mobile app attacks saw a decrease in volume. However, Trojan horse attacks saw sizable increases in the volume of attacks. The rise of Android Banking Trojans surged by 120% in the first half of 2023 alone. This resulted in their share of total attacks increasing from 5% to 11% year-over-year.\nHook Leak\nThe leak of the Hook Android banking Trojan’s APK and Panel source code in 2023 led to significant growth in HookBot Command and Control Centers (C&Cs), with over 200 new C&Cs detected late in the year. Hook leak contributed to the 20% surge in malware attacks.\nPost in fraud forum Translated from Russian by DukeEugene advertising Hook\nA Rise in Digital Banking Fuels Attacks Through Mobile\nMobile app usage continues to increase, and now comprises 85% in total traffic. Outseer has seen that the increase in this channel was accompanied by a parallel trend in increased mobile fraud, with 62% of detected fraud originating from mobile apps. This underscores the urgent need for implementing tailored and robust security measures to effectively address the escalating threat landscape within the mobile domain.\nTrend 2: Instant Payment Scams\nOutseer has seen a significant uptick in unauthorized push payments, mule accounts, and account takeovers in markets where faster payment adoption is high. Surveyed financial institutions saw a spike in fraud attacks using real-time rail: 57% reported mule activity was up, 71% reported consumer ATO had increased, and 62% reported APP fraud had increased.\nFaster payments have seen global adoption, leading to increased authorized push payments (APP), mule accounts, and account takeovers. The UK reported £485 million ($618 million) in APP scam losses in 2023, with projections of $4.6 billion by 2026. The US saw over $10 billion in fraud losses, a 14% increase from 2022.\nWith the introduction of FEDNOW in the US and the increasing adoption of instant payment systems across the globe, combined with the success fraudsters are seeing in these types of scams, more opportunities for scams are expected.\nStopping these scams is difficult because the victims authorize the transactions, often without the realization they are a scam target until after the payment clears.\nIdentifying Mule Accounts Is a Key Step in Stopping Fraudsters\n- Leverage a risk-based approach and take advantage of machine learning that profiles the sender and recipient to more accurately detect mule activities\n- Update policies to track beneficiary transaction velocity and unusual amounts\n- Utilize a data network such as the Outseer Global Data Network to help share mule accounts intelligence with other organizations\n- Tap into the timely insights of web intelligence services such as Outseer Fraud Action Services to identify confirmed mule accounts in addition to compromised email addresses that can be tied to accounts\nRising Liability Shifts\nWith the rapid increase in faster payment fraud, some governments are enacting or are considering legislation to ensure more support for victims, with the discussion centering around liability shift.\nThe UK & EU Are on the Forefront of Regulation\nThe UK and EU have been at the forefront of change with the introduction of the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) and the upcoming Payment Services Directive 3 (PSD3). In late 2024, the specifics of PSD3 and the implementation of the PSR liability shift will be revealed. As these regulatory changes unfold, financial institutions should stay informed and prepare for potential adjustments in compliance requirements based on the finalized PSD3 framework.\nThe most important part of the liability changes is that financial institutions and payment service providers must reimburse all in-scope customers that are victims of APP scams, within certain limits. The sending and receiving financial institutions and payment service providers will share the cost of reimbursements to victims 50-50.\nStrategic objectives of the PSR reimbursement:\n- Decrease the instances of APP fraud\n- Improve protection of payment system users\n- Incentivize payment service providers to focus on resources to prevent scams\n- Increase confidence in the Faster Payment Scheme (FPS)\n- Create agile rules to enable the operator to manage evolving fraud threats\nWhile not mandated to adopt any regulation, those outside of the UK and EU could benefit from the learnings.\nTrend 3: AI-Powered Scams\nAI Fueling Scam Growth\nAI has dominated the headlines over the past year and fraudsters have already begun to exploit this technology, with several major scams reported globally. With new AI tools and technology at their disposal, fraudsters are creating varied phishing emails that defeat existing scam and spam email filters. In addition to improving tried-and-true techniques, fraudsters are using AI more often on deepfakes, voice cloning, verification fraud, and authorized push payment (APP) fraud.\nWhile Outseer didn’t see direct fraud losses from generative AI in 2023, we predict that the scams and corresponding losses will continue to grow. Given the goal of generative AI scams is to trick people into believing what fraudsters put out there, Outseer does believe that generative AI contributed to the increased effectiveness of phishing tactics that fueled an even larger increase in Trojan attacks and malware attacks.\nGenerative AI is enhancing phishing tactics, making scams more convincing. Tools like OpenAI’s Sora can produce hyper-realistic videos, raising concerns about deepfakes and misinformation. The ethical implications and risks of such powerful software are under scrutiny as new Generative AI capabilities are released.\nScreenshot from “Beyond Our Reality” (Sora & Donald Allen Stevenson III)\nDespite the ways generative AI is being manipulated, predictive AI has also played a pivotal role in detecting cyber threats such as brand abuse, phishing, Trojans, and rogue mobile apps. The strength of AI and machine learning in combating these threats lies in their ability to continuously learn, adapt, and detect evolving patterns of malicious behavior across various digital landscapes. These technologies enable proactive and adaptive security measures, ultimately contributing to a more robust defense against cyber threats.\nHow Can Financial Institutions & Payment Service Providers Mitigate APP Fraud?\nFinancial institutions and payment service providers that enhance internal controls can shield themselves from liability-shift losses. Implementing controls can mitigate risk while protecting customers from fraudsters who seek to circumvent an FI’s internal controls by using money mules and executing APP frauds.\nStrategic Recommendations\nIn implementing a robust defense against scams, a multi-layered approach is essential. First, limiting fraudsters’ access to customer credentials and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is paramount. And while many organizations may overlook actively tracking scams, it’s crucial to track and tag scam attacks for analysis. By tracking scams, businesses can analyze data and refine their mitigation strategies accordingly. This enables a more proactive stance in identifying and countering fraudulent activities effectively.\nData Network Consortium\nJoin a data network like Outseer’s Global Data Network for better detection control. Using a broad dataset helps identify risk signals more effectively. “These controls are exceptionally well positioned to be among the most effective scam detection solutions” says Datos Insights.\nAI and Predictive Analytics\nImplement AI and predictive analytics for receive-side detection control. These tools can facilitate risk-based transaction monitoring, slowing down risky real-time payments.\nPolicy Management Solutions\nRegularly update your policy management solutions to adapt to new fraud tactics and regulatory requirements. Clearly defined policies help manage high-risk payments and suspect money mules within regulatory constraints.\nInternal Processes\nEnhance internal controls with proactive prevention measures, such as customer education and “break the spell” teams for APP scams. Monitor both incoming and outgoing transactions to catch fraudsters in action.\nTo dive deeper into these insights and equip your institution with the latest strategies, download the full report and watch the accompanying webinar.', 'Fraudsters are looking to Capitalize on the Mounting International Tensions | Outseer. Fraudsters are looking to Capitalize on the Mounting International Tensions\nCyberNews interviewed Outseer’s CMO + Chief Identity Officer Armen Najarian about the link between rising international tensions and increased scammer activity.\nGlobal unrest is an excellent opportunity for cybercriminals to exploit businesses, creating a need for more protection measures from fraudsters.\nMany people are familiar with the urgent emails in their spam folders – one of the most popular fraud methods. While some easily identify and ignore it, urgency makes others do actions without putting much thought into it. This can put the whole company at risk.\nWhen falling victim to a fraudster’s hands, a password manager or a VPN service will not be enough to protect you. Such data theft prevention requires awareness and advanced fraud protection and prevention tools.\nArmen Najarian, the CMO and Chief Identity Officer at Outseer – a company that specializes in fighting fraud, agreed to discuss such cyberattacks and their prevention methods.\nLet’s go back to the very beginning of Outseer. What was your journey like throughout the years?\nRSA, a leading cybersecurity solution, launched Outseer in June 2021 to authenticate identities, protect users, and prevent fraud. We offer a full suite of anti-fraud and threat intelligence services. By utilizing science, data, and expertise, Outseer focuses on delivering superior customer experiences and comprehensive risk management. In a short time, we have been able to provide security solutions that result in fewer false positives, happier customers, and lower operational costs with no compromise in quality.\nAs for my fraud prevention and cybersecurity journey, I began my career in this space as Chief Marketing Officer at ThreatMetrix. A couple of years later, I took on the role of Chief Marketing and Identity Officer at Agari where I was able to gain some real first-hand experience with how these criminal rings operate. During my time at Agari, my team and I discovered a Nigerian fraud group called Scattered Canary, which was filing fraudulent unemployment claims, receiving benefits from multiple states, and receiving payoffs.\nUltimately, this experience is what drew me into the role at Outseer. I understand the important work our team is doing with fraud protection and monitoring as more and more transactions take place online. Since I started at Outseer, our mission has always been to provide reliable foresight on identity authentication and fraud prevention.\nCan you tell us a little bit about what you do? What are the main issues you help solve?\nOutseer focuses on monitoring the fraud landscape to stay on top of the latest methods being deployed by cybercriminals. Some different types of fraud we look for include rogue mobile apps, phishing, impersonation, and brand abuse. We also work with companies to authenticate customer identities to ensure a person is using legitimate payment credentials that belong to them to purchase goods and services.\nWe offer a selection of solutions for companies to help combat various types of fraud. Our current offerings include Outseer 3-D Secure, Outseer Fraud Manager, Outseer FraudAction, and Outseer Emerging Payments. Each targets a different kind of protection, allowing companies to take a holistic approach to their network security and fraud prevention.\nWhat technology do you use to secure payments without compromising the user experience?\nOutseer uses 3-D Secure to help companies protect customers’ information during online transactions while providing a smooth customer experience. 3-D Secure authenticates users’ identities and protects their information, which increases transaction approvals, making the payments process faster, seamless, and more efficient. Additionally, user identities are verified at various points during transactions making it more accurate. 3D Secure protects various forms of payment, from traditional credit cards to newer methods like CNP and BNPL.\nOutseer Fraud Manager monitors digital transactions to detect fraud, assess users’ risk factors, and deliver fraud detection trends. In addition, Fraud Manager warns users of potential fraud situations before they happen.\nOutseer Fraud Action is an around-the-clock fraud and cybersecurity monitoring service that stops cyberattacks and detects fraudulent activity. Specifically, Fraud Action protects businesses from phishing attacks, malware, rogue mobile apps, impersonators, and fake social media accounts.\nOutseer’s newest addition, Outseer Emerging Payments, was launched to combat fraud for new payment technologies. Buy Now, Pay Later Installments is the first solution offered under this product line.\nDid you notice any new fraud techniques arise as a result of the recent global events?\nThe evolving Russia/Ukraine conflict has drastically influenced the fraud landscape, forcing companies to develop new techniques to combat cybersecurity challenges. From increased phishing and cybersecurity attacks to fake fundraising and hacking attempts, fraudsters are looking to capitalize on the mounting international tensions.\nThe global conflict wasn’t the only factor contributing to a rise in new fraud techniques. With the pandemic also came a wave of touchless technology and payments – one being QR codes. Many restaurants started using QR codes to encourage touchless interactions, but like any card-not-present transaction, there is an opportunity for fraud. Scanning QR codes for menus and payments opens up a new avenue for fraudsters to access private information. It’s hard to verify if a QR code is legit or if a fraudster replaced it to misdirect and scam customers.\nAnother factor is the significant influx of new payment technologies that have hit the market. An example is the “buy now pay later” (BNPL) trend that is currently taking the payment world by storm. Since BNPL transactions are still relatively new and there are multiple parties involved, there is an increased opportunity for fraudsters to take advantage of consumers’ vulnerabilities.\nAt Outseer, we work on staying on top of these global trends to combat these new forms of fraud while educating users about these risks.\nWhat red flags indicate that a user might be malicious or someone is impersonating them?\nImpersonators, fraudsters, and other malicious users are becoming more and more sophisticated in their approach to stealing consumers’ information and creating false accounts. Unfortunately, this makes it harder for people to recognize the signs that they are being scammed.\nA common method bad actors use to trick people and collect personal information is impersonating someone close to you. You can prevent yourself from falling victim to this scam by keeping an eye out for these warning signs:\n- Different Communication Methods. If the person contacting you usually uses a particular form of communication (i.e. text) but is reaching out via a different one (i.e. email), that is a red flag.\n- Unknown Number. If a person is reaching out with a ‘new number,’ be sure to always take it with a grain of salt. A great way to authenticate their identity in this case is to get them on a phone call and see if you recognize their voice.\n- Highly Urgent Requests. If you receive a suspicious email or text that says it requires immediate action (i.e. I need this money by today…), be sure to take a step back and really assess the situation. Fraudsters often try to rush victims into making rash decisions so they don’t feel like they have time to think it through.\nOverall, use your best judgment. If there are any alarm bells going off in your head, there is often a good reason – be sure to always take a step back and investigate.\nWhat cybersecurity risks do you think new business owners often fail to take into account?\nBusiness owners often fail to consider the risks they are putting themselves and customers at when collecting and storing sensitive personal and financial information online. Cybersecurity and fraud prevention should be considered from the start and baked into the foundation of their network. It’s essential that they invest in security options that will protect their information as well as customers.\nIt’s also important to note that securing your network is an ever-evolving process, not a one-time investment. In order to have effective cybersecurity, businesses have to remain committed to updating their systems to ensure the network is able to defend against fraudsters’ new methods and techniques.\nIn your opinion, which organizations are attractive targets for fraudsters and should implement proper security measures as soon as possible?\nAny organization that collects any amount of users’ personal information could be a target for fraudsters. Fraudsters can use as little as an email to commit fraudulent acts or build your profile on the dark web.\nState databases are one of the hottest targets for fraudsters since they often hold a plethora of people’s sensitive information and are often on outdated servers. Most times, these databases are behind on security updates and modern technology, exposing them to vulnerabilities that hackers can (and will) take advantage of.\nIn general, all organizations that collect any sort of information from customers need to make sure they are investing in and implementing the proper security measures as soon as possible, for their and users’ protection.\nTalking about average Internet users, what measures and practices do you think everyone should adopt to protect their identity online?\nAs the digital world continues to grow, more and more sensitive information is being stored online. With the majority of transactions taking place digitally, it’s not a surprise that criminals are committing fraud at astounding levels. While we have enjoyed the flexibilities this age of digital transformation has brought us, it’s essential to recognize the vulnerabilities that have been introduced, too.\nIt is important to remember that oftentimes, fraudsters operate in groups to execute scams and attacks. Rarely is it a singular data breach, hack, or scam responsible for your leaked information and financial losses – it is rather multiple hacks that held various pieces of your information that were used to build a profile on you on the dark web.\nA few things Outseer urges people to do is to protect themselves from fraudsters by updating passwords regularly, using varying passwords between different sites, making sure to check financial statements to monitor for unknown purchases and fraudulent activity, as well as making sure to research payment methods you are unfamiliar with before signing up.\nAnd finally, what’s next for Outseer?\nWith numerous types of emerging payment methods and technology trends shaping the world, including BNPL, Cryptocurrency, and more, Outseer is working to evaluate the security risks of each new method to stay ahead of fraudsters and stop scams before irreversible damage is done.\nOutseer is addressing these new methods and rising fraud trends while maintaining and updating current products to reflect changes in the evolving fraud and cybersecurity landscape. We recently announced the development of our Buy Now Pay Later solution – a product under our new Outseer Emerging Payments solution that authenticates users’ identities at multiple points in the BNPL process to prevent fraud before it happens. We are excited to continue expanding our offerings to stop fraud in its tracks across all avenues.']"

E-Commerce Fraud Protection: An Essential Guide\nWe explain what e-commerce fraud is, the types of e-commerce fraud, how it happens, and top strategies for protecting your organization and your customers.\nWhat is E-Commerce Fraud Protection?\nE-commerce fraud is any type of fraud perpetrated on a retail site or platform, including credit card fraud, identity theft, account takeover, and chargeback fraud. E-commerce fraud protection detects attempted fraudulent activity with strategies such as real-time monitoring, machine learning, and card security requirements.\nWhat Is E-Commerce Fraud?\nE-commerce fraud is a type of fraud that targets online merchants with the goal of stealing information, making fraudulent transactions, or obtaining goods for free.\nAs more businesses shift to online retail fraudsters are following the money. Card-not-present (CNP) fraud and account takeovers continue to cause millions in losses each year. Thanks to the growing number of stolen credit card and login details available through dark web marketplaces, these forms of e-commerce fraud are extremely attractive to cybercriminals.\nBut popular new forms of instant credit payments such as Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) have also attracted the attention of cybercriminals seeking to make illegal transactions.\nIn 2021 alone e-commerce losses due to payment fraud topped $20 billion, a 14% increase from the previous year. It’s clear that consumers will continue to rely on e-commerce, and online retailers will have to take a proactive approach to e-commerce fraud protection.\nTypes of E-Commerce Fraud\nE-commerce fraud goes well beyond stolen credit card details. Below we’ll explain some of the most common forms of e-commerce fraud and provide ways you can defend against them.\nCard Not Present (CNP) Fraud\nCard-not-present fraud occurs when a person makes an unauthorized purchase using stolen credit card information without physical access to the card. CNP fraud can occur anywhere a merchant cannot inspect the physical card.\nIn addition to dark web marketplaces, fraudsters also acquire credit card information through phishing scams that trick users into entering their payment information into a cloned version of a legitimate e-commerce website. Once the victim enters their payment details, the information is sent to the attackers who then sell them or use them to make fraudulent purchases.\nFraud prevention methods like CVV and Address Verification Service (AVS) can stop some of this fraud, but not all of it. CVV codes are often included in stolen data dumps and retrieved from phishing campaigns, while AVS can be bypassed by a few minutes of online research.\nWhat You Can Do:\n- Implement anti-fraud tools that leverage the EMV® 3-D Secure payment protocol\n- Keep e-commerce tools, domains, and websites up to date\n- Take down phishing sites that impersonate your brand to steal customer payment details\n- Limit or block exposure to risky geographic locations\nChargeback Fraud\nChargeback fraud occurs when a purchaser buys a product with the sole intention of initiating a refund and keeping the product. Rather than contacting the online retailer, the customer goes directly to their payment processor to initiate a refund.\nWhen chargeback fraud is done by accident, it’s often referred to as “friendly” fraud. Sometimes customers forget they placed an order, fail to recognize a charge on their statement, or think that a chargeback is another way to initiate a return. Either way, it still hurts revenue, impacts inventory—and is often avoidable.\nWhen chargeback fraud is purposeful, the perpetrator will state they never received the package or claim they never authorized that purchase. When a chargeback occurs the customer is refunded their money and the business is hit with a chargeback fee.\nChargeback fees can quickly cut into a business’s profits. In 2021, Merchants refunded $25.3 billion in fraudulent returns. According to a recent survey, 44% of merchants report experiencing return abuse of some kind over the past 12 months, and 66% say it has been getting worse.\nWhat You Can Do:\n- Make return policies easy to find and understand\n- Use clear transaction descriptions for credit card statements\n- Send auto-renewal reminders and order confirmations when payments have been made\n- Apply strong credit card verification methods to identify repeat offenders\n- Identify fraudulent behavior through machine learning\nAccount Takeover (ATO)\nAccount takeover fraud occurs when a legitimate customer account is hijacked by fraudsters who use that account to steal information, make purchases, and more. This can be particularly challenging to detect since the login occurs under a trusted account.\nCybercriminals can target large organizations in ATO attacks in order to authorize bank transfers or steal company secrets. In e-commerce ATOs, attackers steal customer accounts and abuse their saved payment methods, drain rewards points, or max out their BNPL credit.\nATO attacks now lead to more than $16 billion in annual loss just in the U.S., up 300% from 2019. In addition to impacting revenue, compromised accounts quickly erode the trust between the customer and the brand.\nMachine learning-based risk decisioning is one of the best ways to prevent an account takeover. By monitoring metrics such as geolocation, session data, and device ID, e-commerce platforms can quickly identify suspicious login attempts and prevent fraud entirely.\nWhat You Can Do:\n- Initiate risk-based authentication to protect accounts automatically\n- Support multi-factor authentication (MFA)\n- Watch for logins under new devices and locations that don’t match with the customer’s\n- Shut down phishing sites and rogue mobile apps before they steal customer logins\nInterception Fraud\nInterception fraud occurs when a fraudster uses stolen credit card information to make a purchase and intercepts the package in transit. Fraudsters do this in an attempt to bypass address and location verification during checkout.\nIn most cases, the criminal will call customer service once the transaction has been approved and change the address to their own. The fraudster may even attempt to steal the package as soon as it’s delivered if the victim is local.\nWhat You Can Do:\n- Require additional authentication when making changes to orders or account information\n- Train customer service to recognize attempted interception fraud\n- Provide shipping and billing notifications to customers via email or text\n- Deploy solutions that leverage the EMV® 3-D Secure payment protocol\nBuy Now Pay Later Fraud\nBNPL fraud is expected to rise throughout 2022 as more retailers offer instant financing options. Attackers exploit BNPL systems by creating fake accounts using synthetic identities, account takeover schemes, and phishing scams.\nWith an account in place, fraudsters put their products on layaway financing with no intention of paying their balance. They receive the goods and simply create a new account to repeat the process.\nWhat You Can Do:\n- leverage BNPL protection to automatically block synthetic identities and apply continuous authentication to safeguard BNPL services\n- Review transactions to identify patterns of BNPL fraud in progress (high order values, repeat orders using the same credentials, etc.)\n- Look for transactions that don’t match established user behavior\nAccount Enrollment Fraud\nWhy take over an account when you can use stolen card information to set up an account or rewards program with an online merchant from scratch using synthetic identity data? Today, Synthetic identity theft is one of the fastest-growing financial crimes in the United States, leading to an estimated $20 billion in losses annually.\nIn these attacks, fraudsters open an account or activate a mobile app using pilfered card information. Since the new user appears legitimate, there is no discrepancy between shipping addresses or contact information—helping them bypass most traditional fraud detection systems.\nWhat You Can Do:\n- Require multiple forms of identity proof and running it through external databases\n- Deploy solutions that leverage machine learning and identity science to correlate and verify physical and digital identities\nSigns of E-Commerce Fraud\nE-commerce fraud isn’t always obvious. There are many patterns and behaviors that can indicate fraud but are difficult to manually detect. This is why machine learning and artificial intelligence are such powerful tools in combating fraud.\nBelow are a few signs that could indicate e-commerce fraud:\n- A new device login for an existing account\n- An unusual login location that’s atypical for the user\n- Mismatched shipping/billing address\n- Large purchases of the same product in a single transaction\n- Numerous separate orders placed in quick succession\n- Multiple orders to the same address with different cards\n- The consumer is using a brand new email address\nE-Commerce Fraud Protection Strategies\nWith the signs of e-commerce fraud covered, let’s explore some e-commerce fraud protection strategies that can protect your businesses as well as your customers.\nConduct Site Security Audits\nCybercriminals can exploit vulnerable websites to steal customer payment information. Conduct regular security checks to ensure your site isn’t compromised or vulnerable to attack. A few things to check include the following:\n- Updating or removing outdated plugins\n- Removing old user accounts\n- Enforcing two-factor authentication for your admin login\n- Ensuring SSL and HTTPS is working properly\n- Scanning for malware and indicators of compromise\n- Backing up configurations and website settings\nMaintain PCI Compliance\nPCI compliance helps protect customer data by enforcing protections that keep your customers and your business secure. Conduct self-assessments and monitor your compliance to avoid potential fraud and steep fines from noncompliance.\nThe PCI Security Standards Council has numerous resources you can use to implement better e-commerce fraud protection.\nLeverage Data Science and Machine Learning\nCard issuers, banks, payment processors and merchants should all deploy tools that enhance features built into the EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS) payment standard to prevent transaction fraud.\nCase in point: Outseer 3-D Secure builds upon the 3DS standard by combining it with advanced identity science and shared global intelligence to prevent CNP fraud and protect more than $200 billion in CNP transactions per year.\nThese same advancements in data science and machine learning also power Outseer Fraud Manager, which analyzes behavior and cross-references it with offline and online digital identities and transaction data to detect fraudulent transactions, logins, and new account enrollments—and prevent e-commerce fraud across any channel.\nAvoid Shipping to Nonphysical Addresses\nFraudsters often attempt to use P.O. boxes when committing fraud to avoid compromising their own address. While this isn’t always the case, restricting transactions to P.O. boxes can cut down on the amount of fraudulent transactions processed.\nStopping Fraud, Not Transactions\nThe flip side of e-commerce fraud prevention is customer experience. At a time when shopping cart abandonment continues to impact 75% of all purchases, adding even the slightest customer friction to prevent fraud is a dicey proposition.\nUnlike traditional anti-fraud solutions, Outseer products leverage intelligence from 20 billion annual transactions across 6,000 institutions contributing to our global data network and our identity science expertise to prevent 95% of all fraudulent transactions. This reserves step-up challenges for the scant 5% of transactions that ever require additional scrutiny.\nBy seeing what others can’t, we stop fraud long before an account is created or a fraudulent transaction occurs. To learn how you can protect your customers through the power of frictionless fraud prevention, request a free demo today.', 'Fraud Management: Solutions To Protect Your Organization | Outseer. Fraud Management: Solutions To Protect Your Organization\nWondering about fraud management? We explain what fraud management is, how it works, and what solutions are available.\nWhat Is Fraud Management?\nFraud management encompasses all methods of detecting and preventing fraud. This process involves identifying areas where fraud can occur, assessing your fraud risk tolerance, and deploying systems to prevent and mitigate fraud activities.\nFraud management is now more important than ever. As more financial transactions move to mobile and online channels, banks, credit card companies, payment processors and other organizations are faced with the challenge of ensuring those transactions are both legitimate and secure.\nThat’s because cybercriminal networks always follow the money—a notion that has led to an avalanche of phishing attacks, bogus mobile apps, authorized push payment rip-offs, Buy Now, Pay Later rackets, and countless other scams designed to fool consumers and businesses into revealing payment and login credentials. According to the Federal Trade Commission, consumer fraud losses jumped 79% in 2021. And the FBI reports that businesses lost $200 million more than the year before. And it’s getting worse.\nAcross all industries, card-not-present (CNP) fraud alone could lead to $17.3 billion in losses by 2023, according to the Aite-Novarica Group. Meanwhile, account takeover (ATO) contributes to as much as $16.9 billion in annual losses. And then there’s the use of stolen and synthetic identity data in account enrollment fraud, which is a $6 billion problemthe FBI calls one of the fastest-growing forms of financial crime today.\nAt the heart of it all: Impersonation. Sometimes called “brand exploitation,” “brand abuse,” or even “brand jacking,” cybercriminal impersonation of trusted businesses or individuals soared $274% during the first three quarters of 2001, and is implicated in nearly half (45%) of all cybercrimes worldwide.\nWith no signs of slowing down, organizations are turning to fraud management solutions to protect their brand, staff, and customers. Let’s explore the four most common types of fraud and what businesses are doing to protect themselves.\nFraud Management Strategies\nTo stop fraud, we first must understand what to look for. Below are the four most common types of fraud, how they work, and how you can prevent them in your fraud management strategy.\nFraud Management for E-Commerce Fraud\nE-commerce fraud is a broad category of attacks that aims to defraud businesses by obtaining merchandise for free or disrupting sales from legitimate customers. With more businesses shifting their efforts to online retail, e-commerce fraud continues to gain popularity and take unsuspecting companies by surprise.\nBelow are a few common types of e-commerce:\n- Card-Not-Present Fraud – The use of compromised credit card details to make unauthorized online or mobile purchases, often using automated bots\n- Chargeback Fraud – Occurs when a customer makes a purchase with the intent of issuing a chargeback and keeping the product\n- Friendly Fraud – Exactly like chargeback fraud, but is committed on accident when customers forget they made a purchase and facilitate a chargeback\n- Automated Scalping – Scalpers use bots and other automated techniques to buy out the inventory and resell it at a higher price to legitimate customers\n- Buy Now, Pay Later Fraud – Occurs when fraudsters open a line of credit with no intention of paying it back.\nWhat can you do to prevent these types of payment fraud?\nThe most successful fraud management strategies include risk-based authentication (RBA) that leverages the EMV® 3-D Secure protocol, which has proven remarkably effective in detecting and preventing payment fraud.\nToday’s most robust 3DS-based solutions, for instance, analyze more than 100 different risk indicators to silently authenticate customers before a transaction even occurs. This enables merchants, issuers, and banks to deliver a fast, friendly checkout experience to legitimate customers while blocking fraudsters at the door.\nOrganizations can set thresholds for different risk scores to reflect their fraud risk tolerance. Transactions deemed too risky are sent through a step-up verification process, while legitimate customers are left unimpacted.\nLook for solutions that use artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify bots and bad actors. Unlike rule-based systems, artificial intelligence continuously uses new data to prevent fraud and adapts to new attacks, even when fraudsters change their tactics.\nThe leading options on the market leverage the same technologies to detect synthetic identities used for buy now, pay later scams and block bots used to scalp products or test stolen card information.\nFraud Management for Brand Abuse\nBrand abuse remains one of the most popular forms of fraud due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Brand abusers impersonate trusted brands or individuals to trick employees, customers, suppliers, and others into clicking malicious links, entering their card information, and purchasing counterfeit goods.\nFor consumers who fall prey to these impersonations, the average loss is $1,000—though it can get much higher. When it’s a large business that’s victimized, these attacks can lead to an average $5 million in loss. When impersonation attacks lead to a data breach, it costs US-based companies another $9.05 million on average, per incident.\nGet impersonated, and your brand could also take a hit to its reputation and revenue as your customers and prospects grow wary of your legitimate digital marketing campaigns and channels. According to Forrester, lost customer trust and even just heightened customer suspicion can reduce a company’s revenue by 10% to 25% for up to a year.\nBelow are a few common types of brand impersonation fraud:\n- Phishing Messages – Fraudsters use email, social media, text messages, deepfake voices, and even Zoom meetings in their impersonation scams\n- Phony Brand Mobile Apps – Attackers create malicious apps that impersonate a brand in order to steal data, display ads, and install malware\n- Domain Spoofing – Fraudsters register domain names that look nearly identical to the real branded domain in order to trick visitors and send convincing phishing emails\n- Fake Social Media Accounts – Attackers use fraudulent social media profiles and offers to fool users into costly mistakes\nWhat can you do to prevent brand impersonation?\nThe best way to prevent and manage brand abuse fraud is to stop it before it can reach your customers. But manually patrolling the Internet for brand abuse is impractical and time-consuming.\nInstead, organizations are advised to source fraud intelligence and takedown services that continuously monitor the web, app stores, and social media platforms 24/7 to detect and shut down phishing sites, fraudulent mobile apps, and phony social media pages used in brand impersonation schemes before they can cause serious financial and reputational damage.\nAlong with continuous brand monitoring, organizations should use an email gateway other solutions that analyze incoming email to prevent any phishing messages that do reach their servers from hitting employee inboxes. Conduct regular training inside your organization to raise awareness of phishing scams to minimize your risk.\nAccount Takeover Fraud Management\nAccount takeover (ATO) fraud is notoriously difficult to detect because fraudsters hijack legitimate accounts to carry out attacks. Fraudsters typically gain access to trusted accounts through data breaches and phishing attacks.\nOnce logged in, attackers use their privileged access to make fraudulent purchases, steal valuable information, add beneficiaries, and max out lines of credit. Up to 71.9% of e-commerce fraud was committed through trusted user accounts during the third quarter of 2021. These attacks can leave both customers and businesses blindsided if not prevented.\nBelow are a few common crimes perpetrated in account takeover:\n- Changing Account Information – Attackers typically change account information to lock out customers and move money or products to the attacker\n- Making Fraudulent Purchases – Fraudsters take advantage of saved credit card information to make purchases after they change the shipping address\n- Maxing Out Credit Limits – Attackers max out accounts with Buy Now, Pay Later services to burn through their credit limits\n- Steal Sensitive Information – Accounts can contain other information like social security numbers, bank and credit card details, phone numbers, and more that can be used in more advanced attacks or sold in dark web marketplaces\n- Selling Stolen Accounts – Rather than using the hijacked accounts, some criminals sell them to other fraudsters to exploit at will\nWhat can you do to prevent these types of fraud?\nUnlike traditional password authentication, modern fraud management solutions leverage machine learning to detect account compromise by tracking behavioral norms for each user and watching for anomalous behaviors, devices, locations and other characteristics that could signal fraud. This technique allows companies to identify signs of an ATO and immediately block transactions.\nWhen an account behaves in a way that is indicative of ATO fraud, that user is sent through a challenge flow that requires additional authentication. This extra step can be customized, but it usually comes in the form of one-time password sent via text, email, or authenticator app. When the challenge is complete, the login may proceed.\nThese systems don’t rely on passwords alone and only request step-up verification if the login is considered high risk.\nInternal Fraud Management\nFraud doesn’t always come from outside the organization. Disgruntled staff, curious employees, and deadline-stressed managers might be tempted to commit fraud with their privileged access. Even the most close-knit of teams should have an internal fraud management solution.\nBelow are a few common types of internal fraud:\n- Misappropriation of Funds – Embezzlement and mishandling of company finances are two common examples of misappropriation of funds\n- Theft – Theft can include private data, company property, reward points, and cash\n- Misuse of Company Assets – When staff use company property for personal gain it can be considered misuse\n- Fraudulent Bookkeeping and Reporting – Managers may purposely misreport finances, assets, losses, and other company metrics to meet deadlines or hit goals\nWhat can you do to prevent internal fraud?\nThe best way to manage internal fraud is to set up policies, detection systems, and assign team leaders to oversee anti-fraud measures. Start with identifying all systems that could be vulnerable to abuse. This could range from manipulating quarterly reporting to accessing a company printer for personal use.\nImplement access controls as well as checks and balances for each system on your list. For example, wire transfers should require secondary authorization while company supplies should be secured and a formal mechanism in place for checking them out.\nFinally, assign someone to oversee that these fraud management systems are working. Typically this task is assigned to the head of each department. The same solutions used to prevent account takeover can be leveraged to prevent and alert to internal fraud based on actions and behavior. These systems can also aid in case management during a fraud investigation.\nIn-House vs. Outsourced Fraud Management\nFraud management and prevention are complicated processes involving statistical analysis, data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. This is why many companies choose to partner with a trusted fraud prevention company.\nIn addition to fraud management expertise and cutting-edge technologies, market-leading providers also provide something nearly impossible for organizations to access on their own: globally-shared, cross-industry identity and transaction data. Without it, even organizations with sizable data sharing consortiums will find it nearly impossible to protect against rapidly-evolving fraud techniques.\nWhat to Look for in Fraud Management Solutions\nWith so many fraud management solutions, finding the right one for you can feel daunting. While you’re searching keep in mind your overall goal and keep an eye out for a few of these key features:\n- Frictionless Flow – Look for solutions that offer frictionless flow. This means their fraud prevention system only stops high-risk transactions, providing customers with a better experience and your company a higher conversion rate.\n- Machine Learning – You’ll want a fraud management system that uses machine learning to adapt to the latest threats and accurately flag high-risk behavior. Machine learning is key for scaling and staying ahead of cybercriminals.\n- Intelligence Network – Fraud prevention systems require a vast amount of data to accurately identify fraud. Make sure your fraud management system uses a vast network to gain the latest threat intelligence.\nStop Fraud in Its Tracks With Outseer\nThrough the power of machine learning, data science expertise, and our global data network of 6,000 contributing organizations in every sector and geography, Outseer delivers the best fraud protection in the industry.

We explain what eCommerce fraud is, and discuss the best strategies for prevention.\nWhat Is eCommerce Fraud Prevention?\neCommerce Fraud Is any fraud perpetrated on an ecommerce site or platform. E-commerce fraud prevention is the implementation of strategies for detecting high-risk transactions and preventing fraud. Measures include PCI compliance, AI and machine learning, risk-based monitoring, and more.\nThanks in part to the dramatic shift to online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic, e-commerce fraud could cost online merchants as much as $20 billion for the full year 2021, according to Juniper Research. And it’s easy to see why.\nFrom a criminal perspective, it’s a low-risk, high-value proposition. In the past, fraudsters would have to physically steal credit and cards and use them in brick-and-mortar stores or over the phone. Today, they can easily and inexpensively acquire stolen card details and other credentials through dark web marketplaces. This level of convenience combined with multiple layers of anonymity makes e-commerce fraud extremely attractive to cybercriminals.\nTypes of eCommerce Fraud\nOver the years, fraud has evolved beyond simply exploiting stolen cardholder data. Today, criminals have many ways to carry out e-commerce fraud, with some being much harder to detect and prevent than others. Here’s a look at a few of the most common forms of e-commerce fraud.\nCNP Fraud\nCard Not Present (CNP) fraud occurs when a criminal makes an illicit purchase without physical possession of the payment card.\nAlmost all e-commerce sites require a Card Verification Value (CVV) to prove card ownership, but that’s not always enough. As mentioned, crooks gain access to full card details through dark web marketplaces. They also steal this information directly, through phishing scams.\nFraud prevention methods like CVV and Address Verification Service (AVS) can stop some fraud, but not all of it. CVV codes are often included in stolen data dumps and retrieved from phishing campaigns, while AVS can be bypassed by a few minutes of online research.\nOrganizations can take steps to prevent CNP fraud by:\n- Implementing anti-fraud tools that leverage the EMV® 3-D Secure payment protocol\n- Keeping e-commerce tools, domains, and websites up to date\n- Taking down phishing sites before they harm your brand\n- Limit or block exposure to risky geographic locations\n- Verifying billing addresses through AVS and credit cards with CVVs\nChargeback Fraud\nChargeback fraud occurs when a customer receives the product they paid for, but then initiates a chargeback with the intention to keep both their money and the item. This fraud can be tough to identify because the excuse for a chargeback can vary in each case. For example, fraudsters can claim they never received the item or lie to card issuers by claiming they never made the purchase in the first place.\nWhen chargeback fraud is done by accident, it’s often referred to as “friendly” fraud. Sometimes customers forget they placed an order, fail to recognize a charge on their statement, or think that a chargeback is another way to initiate a return. Either way, it still hurts revenue, impacts inventory—and is often avoidable.\nOrganizations can prevent chargeback and friendly fraud by doing the following:\n- Using strong credit card verification methods to identify repeat offenders\n- Identifying fraudulent behavior through machine learning\n- Providing order confirmation emails\n- Making return policies easy to find and understand\n- Using clear transaction descriptions\nAccount Takeover Fraud (ATO Fraud)\nATO fraud happens when a criminal hijacks a legitimate customer account and uses that account to commit fraud. Fraudsters often attempt to make purchases, drain reward points, make large transfers, and more. ATO attacks now lead to more than $16 billion in annual loss just in the US, up 300% from 2019. This form of fraud is also tough to spot, since the intruder is logging in as a verified customer.\nAccount information is primarily stolen through phishing scams, where victims will unknowingly attempt to log in to a malicious clone of a trusted site. These sites can look indistinguishable from the legitimate company they impersonate and even redirect users to the company’s real site once their information is stolen.\nCompromised accounts impact revenue, but also quickly erode the trust between the customer and the brand. Even if the customer was careless with their account information, it’s up to the e-commerce platform to identify ATO based on behavior.\nMachine learning-based risk decisioning is one of the best ways to prevent an account takeover. By monitoring metrics such as geolocation, session data, and device ID, e-commerce platforms can quickly identify suspicious login attempts and prevent fraud entirely.\nOrganizations can prevent ATO fraud by the doing the following:\n- Protecting customers through risk-based account monitoring\n- Supporting Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\n- Proactively taking down phishing sites before they steal your customer’s data\n- Setting limits on login attempts\nMail Interception Fraud\nMail interception fraud occurs when a criminal uses a stolen credit card or hijacked account to make a purchase that ships to the cardholder’s legitimate address. Once the order is placed, the fraudster will quickly call customer service at the business or its shipping company to change the address or arrange for pick-up at the shipping company’s distribution center.\nThis technique is used to bypass address verification checks and avoid fraud detection systems. Luckily, this type of fraud is easy to prevent by leveraging machine learning and implementing rigorous procedures for changing account information.\nOrganizations can prevent mail interception fraud by doing the following:\n- Using robust payment security to prevent the transaction\n- Training customer service to identify interception fraud\n- Requiring additional authentication when making changes to orders or account information\nAccount Enrollment Fraud\nWhy take over an account when you can use stolen card information to set up an account or rewards program with an online merchant from scratch?\nToday, the volume of stolen and synthetic identity information is climbing fast, with losses stemming from identity theft surging 42% in 2020, according to Aite Group. The Federal Trade Commission reports that as much as 88% of credit card fraud in the US now consists of thieves opening up new accounts.\nIn these attacks, fraudsters open an account or activate a mobile app using pilfered card information. Since the new user appears legitimate, there is no discrepancy between shipping addresses or contact information—helping them bypass most traditional fraud detection systems.\nOrganizations can prevent account enrollment fraud by:\n- Requiring multiple forms of identity proof and running it through external databases\n- Deploying solutions that leverage machine learning and identity science to correlate and verify physical and digital identities\nBrand Impersonation\nBrand impersonation is now implicated in 49% of all fraud attacks worldwide. Brand abuse is by far the most prominent attack vector for cybercriminals due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Cybercriminals steal brand images, company assets, and register closely related domain names in order to trick unsuspecting customers.\nBrand impersonation is most prevalent in social media- and email-based phishing campaigns, but can also be found in text messages and increasingly, fraudulent brand mobile apps. In these scams, fraudsters leverage the stolen brand’s reputation to bamboozle victims out of their money and harvest their card details.\nBrand abuse is costly to both consumers and e-commerce merchants. Consumers stand to lose not only their money through a fake purchase, but also their payment and shipping information. This stolen information is typically used to perpetrate CNP fraud or is sold to others on the dark web.\nConsumers often don’t understand how the attack was carried out and hold the brand responsible. This loss of customer trust can lead to negative reviews and news reports that render a brand’s legitimate mobile apps and email and social media communications radioactive to leery customers and prospects—hobbling critical revenue channels. Prevention is vital when combating brand abuse as larger companies are often targeted more frequently.\nOrganizations can prevent brand abuse by doing the following:\n- Setting up proactive brand abuse monitoring and takedown services\n- Implementing strong email security such as DKIM, SPF, and DMARC\n- Educating staff and customers on identifying fraudulent messaging\n- Using email filtering to protect your network from phishing attacks\nIdentifying Fraud in Your E-commerce Business\nFraud is an evolving game of cat and mouse, but by identifying the telltale signs of fraud, prevention systems can be built to automatically stop new attacks.\nHere are a few risk factors that could indicate e-commerce fraud:\n- New device login for an existing account\n- Unusual login location\n- Mismatched shipping/billing address\n- Large purchases of the same product in a single transaction\n- Numerous separate orders placed in quick succession\n- Multiple orders to the same address with different cards\n- The consumer is using a brand new email address\nTo automate fraud detection, merchants can leverage machine learning algorithms to identify these and other red flags.\nHow to Prevent E-commerce Fraud\nIdentifying fraud is only half the battle; it takes proactive measures to recognize high-risk users and activities and prevent fraudulent transactions before they even happen. Let’s review some steps you can take to prevent e-commerce fraud.\nDefine Your Strategy\nUnderstanding your fraud and risk tolerance is key in fraud prevention. For card issuers, banks, and merchants, it’s critical that each channel should have appropriate layers of protection, backed by policies that balance fraud prevention and user experience in accordance with your tolerance. Do you throttle up fraud prevention to avoid loss at the risk of customers defecting to competitors? Or do you prioritize customer experience to outplay rivals while risking serious damage to your bottom line? The best solutions will have strategies for each channel that stop fraud while preserving the customer experience.\nFollow PCI Standards\nFollowing the Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards keep merchants in line with best data security practices and legal requirements. These standards help identify weaknesses in fraud protection through self-assessments and official audits conducted by Qualified Security Assessors.\nThere are 12 key steps that can help merchants easily achieve PCI compliance:\n- Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data.\n- Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.\n- Protect stored cardholder data.\n- Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.\n- Use and regularly update antivirus software or programs.\n- Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.\n- Restrict access to cardholder data on a need-to-know basis.\n- Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access.\n- Restrict physical access to cardholder data.\n- Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.\n- Regularly test security systems and processes.\n- Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel.\nImplement Layers of Security Throughout the Perimeter—and Beyond\nThere is no single foolproof solution to e-commerce fraud. Merchants should strategically deploy layers of technology that together create a web of interconnected safeguards. For instance, card issuers, banks, payment processors and merchants should all deploy tools that enhance features built into the EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS) payment standard to prevent transaction fraud.\nUsing our own product as an example, Outseer 3-D Secure builds upon the 3DS standard by combining it with advanced identity science and shared intelligence from global, cross-industry transaction data to prevent CNP fraud. Merchants around the world leveraged our technology to protect more than $100 billion in CNP transactions in just the first half of 2021.\nLikewise, merchants can leverage email standards such as DMARC help prevent phishing-based brand impersonation attacks, and brand abuse monitoring and takedown services like Outseer FraudAction to shut down the sites (as well as imposter apps and social media pages) used to harvest login and payment credentials from the victims in these attacks.\nPut Data Science and Machine Learning to Work Across All Channels\nAdvancements in machine learning and big data analytics present one of the best ways to proactively counter e-commerce fraud when transactions may occur across the web, mobile, IoT, API, voice, or any number of other channels.\nCase in point: Outseer Fraud Manager, which analyzes behavior and cross-references it with offline and online digital identities and transaction data spanning every industry and geography, to detect fraudulent transactions, logins and new account enrollments and prevent e-commerce fraud across any channel.\nStop Fraud, Not Customers\nOf course, there’s one other factor central to e-commerce fraud prevention strategies: the customer experience. At a time when shopping cart abandonment continues to impact 75% of all purchases, leading to $4 trillion in lost revenue potential each year, adding any customer friction to prevent fraud is a gamble.\nUnlike traditional anti-fraud solutions, Outseer products read between the lines to understand how legitimate customers behave—stopping 95% of all fraud loss while reserving step-up challenges for the scant 5% of transactions that ever require intervention. That’s the best performance in the industry.\nWith Outseer, checkout times are reduced by 85% and cart abandonment by 70% while fueling consumer confidence and loyalty. Which means a whole lot more revenue for merchants, banks, card issuers and payment processors. And a whole lot less for fraudsters.\nTo learn how you can protect your customers through the power of frictionless e-commerce fraud prevention, request a free demo today.']"

Payment Security: Everything You Need to Know\nWe explain all aspects of payment security, the steps you can take to protect your organization and your customers’ data, and the obligations that come with it.\nWhat Is Payment Security?\nPayment security involves the steps businesses take to make sure that their customers’ data is protected and to avoid unauthorized transactions and data breaches. Important aspects of payment security include following protocols such as PCI Compliance and 3-D Secure (3DS).\nPayment security has multiple layers and different requirements depending on the type of business you operate. With eCommerce showing no signs of slowing down, it’s more important than ever for credit card issuers and their merchant customers to implement robust payment security. Multiple layers of payment security are required to protect your business from processing fraudulent transactions, for which you could be liable.\nCompliance plays a critical role in how payment security is designed and implemented. Let’s explore how one of the most common standards shapes payment security requirements.\nPayment Security and PCI Compliance\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a standard that aims to make payment security consistent worldwide.\nAny organization that processes, transmits, or stores cardholder data must comply with PCI DSS requirements. These requirements shape how payment security is implemented and evolve to reflect changes in new fraud prevention techniques.\nHow your business proves PCI compliance will depend on how many transactions you process annually. There are four merchant levels businesses can fall into, with Level 1 having the strictest requirements and Level 4 having the least.\nFor instance, at Level 4, merchants can demonstrate their compliance through a self-assessment, while Level 1 requires them to submit to an external audit conducted by a certified security assessor. Different integrations with payment gateways can lower a merchant’s required compliance level if the transaction takes place in the payment processor’s environment versus on the merchant’s own website.\nNo matter how many transactions you process, having the right payment security in place will help you pass PCI compliance and prevent fraudulent transactions in your business.\nTypes of Payment Security\nTokenization\nTokenization secures transactions by replacing payment information with randomly generated strings of characters. These tokens allow businesses to provision customer accounts, set up scheduled payments, and manage payment settings without handling sensitive cardholder information each time.\nTokens use a public and private key to work. The public key allows for token creation, while the private key allows the merchant to issue single or recurring payments. This form of payment security helps ensure cardholder data is stored securely and reduces the amount of times payment information is transmitted over the internet.\nAddress Verification Service (AVS)\nAVS compares the address provided at checkout with the known address of the cardholder. The tool verifies whether or not the addresses match via a response code sent by the credit card company. While this is useful when paired with other methods of fraud prevention, by itself AVS is quite limited.\nTypos, misspellings, and outdated address information can all inadvertently trigger an AVS mismatch, causing friction for legitimate customers. AVS alone cannot guarantee fraud protection, so it’s best to combine AVS with other forms of payment security.\nSSL Protocol\nSecure Socket Layer (SSL) is an internet protocol that encrypts all communications on a website and is especially important for securing web pages that process customer payment information. Customers can see if a site is using SSL by searching their address bar for a lock icon or verifying that the site address begins with “HTTPS.” Many browsers now alert visitors when a site isn’t using SSL.\nThe good news: Acquiring an SSL certificate is both easy and affordable. Administrators can install SSL certificates to secure web applications and checkout pages; just be sure to renew your certificates before they expire. The bad news: Cybercriminals are increasingly acquiring SSL certificates for fraudulent sites.\nCard Verification Value (CVV)\nCVV is a three- or four-digit code on the back of a credit card designed to verify the purchaser has physical possession of the card. While CVV can certainly help prevent Card Not Present (CNP) fraud, it’s far from foolproof.\nData breaches can expose stolen CVV numbers, and fraudsters can simply physically write down your card information by hand. Like AVS, CVV is best used in conjunction with other payment security methods to provide an additional layer of security\n3-D Secure (3DS)\n3DS is one of the most widely used forms of payment security that continuously evolves to counter fraud. The power of 3DS comes from the data-rich information collected during and before checkout.\nInformation such as IP address, transaction history, and purchase amount are all factored in and analyzed for risk. In total there are over 100 data points collected regarding the cardholder, their device, and the nature of the transaction.\nThis information is shared among the acquirer bank, the issuer bank, and the supporting infrastructure for the protocol. All three parties work together to process the request, provide a risk assessment, and authenticate or challenge the transaction. This process uses statistical analysis to transform contextual information into a risk score for each transaction in just a few seconds.\nIf the transaction is deemed risky or there simply isn’t enough information to validate the transaction, the customer is sent through a challenge flow to provide additional identification. Common challenges include One-Time Passwords (OTP) sent via text or email. Unlike earlier versions of 3DS, only suspicious transactions are issued a challenge flow. This creates a frictionless experience for legitimate customers, improving conversion rates while protecting against fraud.\nPayment Security Best Practices\nOne of the simplest ways to follow best payment security practices is to follow the PCI data security framework: Assess, Remediate, and Report.\nAssess\nTake inventory of your digital assets, and review your procedures for processing cardholder data. Most merchants can use the Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) to review their payment security. Larger companies processing a high amount of transactions annually may need to hire a Qualified Assessor to professionally audit their organization.\nRemediate\nOnce payment security issues have been identified, they can be properly fixed. Remediation steps can consist of repairing misconfigurations, implementing encryption, or fixing vulnerable code. The assessment phase helps provide actionable steps to take during the remediation process.\nReport\nRegular reports are required to maintain PCI DSS compliance. PCI compliance is not enforced, meaning it’s up to the merchant to ensure their payment security meets the proper requirements. The level of reporting merchants need to provide depends on their merchant level.\nWhat’s the Best Form of Payment Security?\nEffective payment security offers many layers of protection without impacting the customer journey. 3DS makes it easy to protect your brand and customers at the same time, making it one of the best forms of payment security available.\nReduce Risk\n3DS uses robust datasets and real-time fraud intelligence to significantly reduce the risk of fraud. Even if stolen card information is used to make a purchase, it is highly unlikely the fraudster will be able to complete the OTP challenge triggered by the 3DS challenge flow.\nCustomer Experience\nThe latest version of 3DS creates a seamless customer experience, unlike older methods of payment security. 3DS makes it easy for the customer to complete their transactions across multiple devices and inside mobile apps. By only issuing a challenge flow on suspicious transactions, 3DS provides one of the most customer-friendly solutions to fraud prevention.\nThe Outseer Solution\nOutseer 3-D Secure provides the best 3DS-enabled payment authentication without sacrificing user experience.

We explain what 3-D Secure authentication is, how it works, and how it helps protect merchants and customers from fraudulent transactions.\nWhat Is 3-D Secure Authentication?\nThe EMV® 3-D Secure payment protocol is designed to provide an additional layer of protection to help prevent fraud. 3-D Secure authentication is a process where customers verify their identity with their payment card issuers when making purchases in digital channels.\nBusinesses use the 3-D Secure protocol to protect from fraud without impacting their customers or slowing down legitimate transactions. The latest version of 3-D Secure authentication uses frictionless flow, which preserves the customer experience by only intervening when a transaction is highly suspicious.\nWhy Is 3-D Secure Authentication Important?\nThe more consumers and businesses continue to shift to e-commerce and digital payment methods, the more cybercriminals look to exploit card-not-present (CNP) transactions. Without traditional safeguards such as chip readers or PIN-pad devices, card issuers and merchants leave themselves and consumers at higher risk of fraud. In 2021, CNP fraud loss topped $15.3 billion, and could exceed $17.2 billion by 2023.\nPayments that have been successfully authenticated using the 3-D Secure (3DS) protocol are covered by liability shift. Liability shift is how banks and processors handle fraud and incentivize all parties to follow best fraud prevention practices.\nAs CNP transactions continue to gain popularity, more merchants and issuers stay ahead of regulatory requirements such as SCA by using 3-D Secure authentication. In 2021, Outseer noted a continuous rise in 3-D secure authentication in the United Kingdom, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and the western world. While SCA isn’t mandatory in the United States, many believe it’s only a matter of time before similar regulatory requirements are put in place.\nWhat Kind of Fraud Does 3-D Secure Authentication Protect Transactions from?\n3-D Secure authentication helps combat CNP fraud by ensuring the legitimate cardholder is the one making a purchase.\nWith the dark web awash with breached credit card data, fraudsters can easy acquire high volumes of credit card numbers and other personal information—or steal it through phishing scams. So 3-D Secure transparently authenticates cardholders by assessing as many as 100 different data elements.\nIn the rare instance additional scrutiny is warranted, one-time passcodes (OTPs) or other out-of-band authentication can be used to verify the relationship between the cardholder and a transaction. OTPs are typically sent via text, email, or push notification but can also be generated through two-factor authentication apps. This process uses separate channels to verify the identity of the customer further.\nIn addition to OTPs, businesses can also use biometric data in 3-D Secure authentication. For example, voice print verification can be used while on the phone, while a fingerprint scan can be used during a touchless transaction.\nHow 3-D Secure Authentication Works\n3-D Secure involves three different parties or “domains” to function, the acquiring bank, the issuing bank, and the infrastructure used to support the protocol. Together these three parties share information about the transaction, known fraud, and the cardholder to determine the risk of a transaction and prevent fraud.\nAuthentication Request\nDuring checkout, the customer enters their card details and submits their payment details. In mere seconds the 3-D Secure provider sends a data-rich request to the card issuer. This request contains over 100 different data points that help the issuer understand the risk associated with the transaction. These data points include:\n- Device age\n- Account age\n- Device ID\n- IP address\n- Transaction amount and history\n- Session statistics (browser type, typing speed, etc.)\nThis contextual data is key to securing transactions, and helps pave the way for more robust forms of payment authentication.\nAssessment\nThe request is received by the issuer’s 3-D Secure provider and assigns the transaction a risk score. This score is generated by comparing the data in the request to statistical threat models. Thanks to machine learning algorithms, this process only takes a few seconds.\nAuthentication or Challenge Flow\nIf there is enough data to determine the cardholder’s identity, the customer proceeds through checkout without additional steps. This ensures legitimate customers receive a frictionless experience when shopping and helps improve conversion rates and reduce cart abandonment.\nIf the transaction is deemed high risk, the customer is sent through a challenge flow for additional verification. This is where the merchant’s 3D-Secure authentication kicks in. The user will be required to authenticate themselves via OTP or biometric scan. If the customer passes the authentication challenge flow, they proceed to checkout.\nFraud Protection Doesn’t Have to Cost You Conversions\n3D-Secure providers can make highly accurate risk assessments that streamline checkout, prevent fraud, and build brand loyalty by leveraging the latest statistical models, partner insights, and threat intelligence.\nOutseer 3-D Secure, for example, is an Access Control Server (ACS) that provides the best in 3DS-enabled payment authentication without sacrificing user experience. With the Outseer Risk Engine at its core and informed by intelligence from our global data network partners, Outseer 3-D Secure transparently evaluates each transaction in real time to prevent 95% of all fraud, with only 5% of transactions ever requiring intervention.\nBy seeing what others can’t, Outseer 3-D Secure protected more than $100 billion in payment transactions in just the first half of 2021.

We explain what it is and how this extra layer of security prevents fraudulent credit and debit card transactions.\nWhat Is 3-D Secure?\n3-D Secure (3DS) is a payment protocol designed to provide an additional layer of protection to help prevent fraud by enabling consumers to authenticate themselves with their payment card issuers when making purchase in digital channels. The “3D” stands for the three domains three parties, or “domains”—the acquirer bank, the issuer bank, and the infrastructure supporting the protocol, whether it’s the Internet or software providers.\nArcot Systems and VISA first developed the protocol to improve the security of online payments and reduce fraud. Merchants used the first version of the 3DS protocol in 1999 to stop fraudulent purchases online and enhance the security of digital payments.\nThis version, along with 3DS 1.0 (or 3DS1) helped reduce fraud, but also introduced numerous problems for e-commerce. Among other things, it required credit card users to enroll in the system using static passwords that many would promptly forget. When making a purchase, 3DS assessed 15 rudimentary data elements to verify identity. And because 3DS shifted liability for fraudulent purchases to card issuers, they often took a “better safe than sorry” approach that meant friction was all but guaranteed.\nWhat’s more, a lot changed over the next 15 years—including the adoption of mobile as the go-to channel for Web browsing and purchases. With 3DS1, mobile users who couldn’t remember their passwords were redirected to a bank page that, more times than not, wasn’t optimized for mobile. SMS was used as an alternative, but presented issues of its own.\nThese extra steps caused a spike in cart abandonment and online conversion rates cratered. With card issuers responsible for fraudulent transactions, removing this secondary form of authentication wasn’t going to happen. It would be another 15 years before a solution would emerge.\n3-D Secure 2.0 Improvements\nIn 2016, 3DS2 was developed to overcome the limitations found in early versions of the protocol. The second version was completely redesigned to improve security and provide a frictionless flow experience for legitimate customers. 3DS2 represented a significant improvement because it:\n- Supports mobile phones and other consumer-connected devices\n- At purchase, data is sent first to the issuing bank to see if it needs additional verification\n- Only risky transactions require challenges; otherwise, a “frictionless flow” process is initiated\nThis enables merchants to integrate the authentication process into their checkout experiences. Issuing banks can authorize payments using risk-based authentication, with no additional steps required by consumers.\nThe Rise of 3DS 2.1 and 2.2\nOne of the latest improvements to 3-D Secure was published in 2019 as 3DS 2.1 increases the number of data elements merchants send to issuers at the point of transaction to 100, with 20 required and the rest optional but recommended by EMVCo, the consortium behind the standards.\nA richer dataset that includes information such as email and IP address, shipping address, and device status are shared with the issuer, allowing issuers to authenticate transactions faster—enabling far more transactions to be handled without friction.\n3DS 2.2 not only builds on the foundation of the previous version but also adds the ability to authenticate through their acquirer or digital wallet provider. For these reasons and more, 3-D Secure has become the cornerstone of online payment authentication.\nHow 3-D Secure Works\nWith the advent of 3DS2, card issuers and payments processors no longer have to choose between lowering fraud at the cost of conversions. But how does 3-D Secure fraud prevention work?\nAuthentication Request\nAt checkout, the customer enters their card details. Behind the scenes, the merchant’s 3-D Secure provider sends an authorization request to the issuer. This request contains over 100 data points about the cardholder, their device, and previous transactions they have made.\nRisk Assessment\nThe issuer’s 3-D Secure provider receives the data-rich request and assigns that transaction a risk score. These data points are compared against threat models using machine learning and statistical analysis. This method of fraud detection happens in mere seconds.\nAuthentication or Challenge\nIf there is enough data to authenticate the user, the transaction proceeds through a frictionless flow, with no other input required from the customer. If the transaction is suspicious, the customer is sent through a challenging flow to provide additional information.\nChallenges may include a One Time Password (OTP) sent via text, a biometric fingerprint scan, or some other measure. Advancements in risk-based authentication have dramatically reduced transaction fraud while preserving the customers online experience.\nThe Importance Of 3-D Secure 2.x\nOrganizations that have migrated to Outseer 3-D Secure reap cost savings from fewer chargebacks and related losses. But there are also numerous other benefits.\nHigher Online Conversion Rates\nExperts state that 3DS2 has reduced checkout times by 85% and cart abandonment by 70%. Thanks to mobile compatibility and larger data sets in 3DS2, customers experience fewer interruptions and a better experience across their devices. This translates to revenue increases for banks and card networks, and more interchange fees for issuers.\nRock Solid Security\nBecause of its use of two-factor authentication (including biometrics and token-based models, instead of static passwords) 3DS2 is central to the secure customer authentication (SCA) rules in the EU’s second Payment Services Directive (PSD2). As part of that version, merchants hitting low fraud thresholds can request exemption from SCA requirements from the issuer, providing for even faster transactions.\nWhile the United States doesn’t currently enforce SCA, it’s still catching on for a number of reasons.\nWhile merchants and issuers doing business in the EU’s $300 billion ecommerce market are exempt from PSD2’s SCA requirements, that could change. What’s more, regulatory fervor is spreading everywhere—Australia, Mexico and others have started to enact SCA requirements. It’s simply just a matter of time before state and federal regulators begin mandating such standards as well. Which means implementing the latest version of 3-D Secure will help keep organizations ahead of the curve.\nMerchant-friendly Features\nMany merchants have resisted the EMV 3-D Secure protocol over concerns about it interfering with the consumer check-out experience. Admittedly, the first version of the protocol was cumbersome for consumers and led to increased cart abandonment rates. Thankfully, the second version provides for a completely frictionless experience. It also introduced a number of features to make the protocol more appealing to merchants than ever.\n- An extension of the shift in liability, whereby merchants are no longer responsible for covering the cost of fraudulent transactions\n- Automatic enrollment of consumers in the program so they no longer need to sign up themselves\n- Additional data elements that can yield more accurate assessments of fraud transaction risk in real time are included\n- Merchants gain the ability to make the final call on whether or not to challenge a user for step-up authentication\n- Support for multiple payment channels, including mobile devices, digital wallets, and gaming consoles as transaction volumes, values (and fraud) keep climbing\nThe Outseer Solution\nAdopting 3DS is just smart business. And in North America, issuers, merchants, and others can leverage fully-hosted solutions such as our own.
